It also turned out to be highly inefficient and thus a new approach based on the advantages of the Pandas library has been implemented. As a result, the cell with AI-generated code was removed and replaced with this hand-written function.

       "      <th>i have been lucky enough to have a career path that has allowed me to work in various manufacturing industries in multiple states (and even in asia). just to name some of the key industries i have worked in: aerospace, semiconductor, steel production, oil refining, chemical refining, and telecommunications. the thought that any of these key industries, that are the building blocks for modern society, can just be replaced by ai is not a commonly-held belief from anyone i have worked with.\\n\\nlet's look at just one of these industries as an example: semiconductors (more commonly known as microchips, something that ai relies heavily on). the microchip manufacturing process relies on dozens of metals and hundreds of chemicals. each metal and chemical that it relies on can be traced back to separate companies that work on refining said metals and chemicals. so that's already hundreds of companies that we rely on to just provide the raw material used to make microchips. now add on the trades, contractors, builders, and the vendors that supple the machines that we use ([see here for an example of what just one machine looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/damnthatsinteresting/comments/1an9dy5/asmls_latest_chipmaking_machine_weighs_as_much_as/). we need hundreds of these.) you can easily see that not only does the process of creating microchips require tons of people, it relies on thousands of other companies that also employee tons of people.\\n\\nif your response is \"well robots are going to be able to replace many of those jobs soon\", i just simply would have to see proof of that. like at all. the microchip manufacturing process actually is already fully automated (meaning from start to finish not one human has to touch the microchip; it moves from one station to the next through the use of robots) and yet it still relies on thousands of engineers and technicians to maintain, improve, innovate, and troubleshoot the process.\\n\\nbut let's play with the idea that robots eventually do replace nearly every modern day job in, say, a century or two. what would that look like? this is where i believe that people who think that ai is going to replace most jobs lose sight of macroeconomics, or perhaps better said, human nature. if we ever got to the point that robots could do every manufacturing job, every service job, every tech job, every legal job, etc., then it would still require people to design, build, and improve said robots. companies will compete to create the newest, fastest, most innovative robot. technicians will service the robots. engineers would design the robots. marketing teams would advertise the newest, greatest robot. business owners would run the business associated with creating robots. not to mention, in this utopian (dystopian?) world, there would still be demand for chef-made meals (i mean this already exists... would you rather eat ultra processed foods or a freshly made meal?), entertainment, and many other services provided by humans.\\n\\nnow, if you want to make the argument that ai will speed up inequality, i can understand that position. those that own the ai companies have a lot to gain and i am open to that argument. but the argument that as ai progresses, more and more people are just gonna go home and twiddle their thumbs all day cause they got nothing to do is simply not based on any historical precedent. millions of jobs have gone obsolete in the past, and millions of jobs will continue to be replaced. there will be hiccups, but as long as the human race has the drive to innovate and progress, there will always be jobs.</th>\n",

generation, there are a ton of interesting and free tools coming out that are worth trying and using as inspiration for your own projects.\\n\\nthese tools cover a bunch of different use cases and can hopefully help some of you, whether you?檙e a professional designer looking to automate parts of your work or just someone who wants to find ways to speed up the design work for your business/side projects.\\n\\nall of them are free to try, but most have some kind of paid plan or limit on the number of free generations. fair enough given it costs money to run the models, but i've tried to include notes on any that don't have permanent free plans. let me know if you know of any tools i?檝e missed so i can add them to the list! i?檝e grouped them by categories, to make it easier to see what each tool is capable of, then given a bit more detail under each specific tool.\\n\\n## ai website, graphic and ui generators:\\n\\n* [**framer**](https://framer.com)**:** describe the website you want, and framer will create it for you. edit and instantly publish your site from their platform. ironically my favorite thing about framer isn?檛 its ai tool. its real advantage is its website editor which is the best i?檝e seen on any platform (and usable for free). it?檚 like figma if figma let you publish directly to the web.\\n* [**microsoft designer**](https://designer.microsoft.com/)**:** generates designs based on user input for social media posts, logos, and business graphics. it?檚 free to use with a microsoft account, and fairly impressive if not always consistent. if you pay a lot or spend a ton of time on design/social media content, designer is definitely worth checking out.\\n* [**uizard**](https://uizard.io/)**:** transforms text and images into design mockups, wireframes, and full user interfaces. it?檚 an ambitious concept, but very cool. while framer was better for generating websites from text prompts, uizard offers something none of the others did: taking a sketch drawing and turning it into a ui and/or wireframing.\\n\\n## visualizations, graphics and illustrations:\\n\\n* [**taskade**](https://taskade.com/)**:** ai powered productivity tool to visualize your notes, projects, and tasks. taskade lets you easily generate mind maps and other visualizations of your work, and makes use of ai in a bunch of cool ways. for example, you can generate a mind map to help you brainstorm and then ask it to expand on a certain point or even research it for you with the internet.\\n* [**bing image creator**](https://www.bing.com/create)**:** generate images from natural text descriptions, powered by dall-e. whether you?檙e looking for blog illustrations, images for your site?檚 pages or any other purpose, it?檚 worth trying.\\n* [**autodraw**](https://www.autodraw.com/)**:** autodraw is a google project that lets you draw something freehand with your cursor, and autodraw uses ai to transform it into a refined image with icons and predrawn designs, all for free in your browser.\\n\\n## ai presentations and slides:\\n\\n* [**plus ai for google slides**](https://www.plusdocs.com/)**:** ai generated slides and full-on presentations, all within google slides. i liked how plus ai worked within google slides and made it easy to make changes to the presentation (as lets be real, no ai tool is going to generate *exactly* the content and formatting you need for a serious presentation).\\n* [**slidesgo**](https://slidesgo.com/)**:** generate slides with illustrations, images, and icons chosen by ai. slidesgo also has their own editor to let you edit and refine the ai generated presentation.\\n* [**tome**](https://tome.app/)**:** tell tome what you want to say to your audience, and it will create a presentation that effectively communicates it clearly and effectively. tome actually goes beyond just presentations and has a few cool formats worth checking out that i could see being useful for salespeople and anyone who needs to pitch an idea or product at work or to clients.\\n\\n## product photography:\\n\\nthese are all fairly similar so i?檝e kept the descriptions short, but it?檚 genuinely a pretty useful category if you run any kind of business or side hustle that needs product photos. these photos establish the professionalism of your store/brand, and all the ones i tried had genuinely impressive results that seemed much better than what i could do myself.\\n\\n* [**pebblely**](https://pebblely.com/)**:** ai image generator for product images in various styles and settings. 40 free images, paid after that.\\n* [**booth.ai**](http://booth.ai/)**:** generates professional-quality product photos using ai, focused on furniture, fashion, and packaged goods.\\n* [**stylized.ai**](http://stylized.ai/)**:** generates product photos integrated into ecommerce platforms like shopify.\\n\\n## miscellaneous tools:\\n\\n* [**fronty**](https://fronty.com/)**:** converts uploaded images or drawings into html and css code using ai. it?檚 a bit clunky, but a cool concept nonetheless.\\n* [**letsenhance**](https://letsenhance.io/)**:** uses ai to enhance the resolution of images and photographs. generally works pretty well from my experience, and gives you 10 free credits with signup. unfortunately beyond that it is a paid product.\\n* [**remove.bg**](http://remove.bg/)**:** specializes in recognizing and removing image backgrounds effectively. doesn?檛 promise much, but it does the job and doesn?檛 require you to sign up.\\n\\n## tl;dr/overall favorites:\\n\\nthese are the ones i've found the most use for in my day-to-day work.\\n\\n* **framer:** responsive website design with a full-featured editor to edit and publish your site all in one place. free + paid plans.\\n* **taskade:** visualize and automate your workflows, projects, mind maps, and more with ai powered templates. free + paid plans.\\n* **microsoft designer:** generate social media and other marketing graphics with ai. free to use.\\n* **plus ai:** plugin for google slides to generate slide content, designs, and make tweaks with ai. free + paid plans.\\n* **pebblely:** professional-quality product photos in various settings and backgrounds, free to generate *up to 40 images* (through you can always sign
