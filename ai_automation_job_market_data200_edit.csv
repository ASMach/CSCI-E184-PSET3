CMV: People who think that most jobs are going to be replaced by AI in the next couple decades have very little understanding of how modern societies function and have a skewed view of macroeconomics.,"I have been lucky enough to have a career path that has allowed me to work in various manufacturing industries in multiple states (and even in Asia). Just to name some of the key industries I have worked in: aerospace, semiconductor, steel production, oil refining, chemical refining, and telecommunications. The thought that any of these key industries, that are the building blocks for modern society, can just be replaced by AI is not a commonly-held belief from anyone I have worked with.

Let's look at just one of these industries as an example: semiconductors (more commonly known as microchips, something that AI relies heavily on). The microchip manufacturing process relies on dozens of metals and hundreds of chemicals. Each metal and chemical that it relies on can be traced back to separate companies that work on refining said metals and chemicals. So that's already hundreds of companies that we rely on to just provide the raw material used to make microchips. Now add on the trades, contractors, builders, and the vendors that supple the machines that we use ([see here for an example of what just one machine looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1an9dy5/asmls_latest_chipmaking_machine_weighs_as_much_as/). We need hundreds of these.) You can easily see that not only does the process of creating microchips require tons of people, it relies on thousands of other companies that also employee tons of people.

If your response is ""well robots are going to be able to replace many of those jobs soon"", I just simply would have to see proof of that. like at all. The microchip manufacturing process actually is already fully automated (meaning from start to finish not one human has to touch the microchip; it moves from one station to the next through the use of robots) and yet it still relies on thousands of engineers and technicians to maintain, improve, innovate, and troubleshoot the process.

But let's play with the idea that robots eventually do replace nearly every modern day job in, say, a century or two. What would that look like? This is where I believe that people who think that AI is going to replace most jobs lose sight of macroeconomics, or perhaps better said, human nature. If we ever got to the point that robots could do every manufacturing job, every service job, every tech job, every legal job, etc., then it would still require people to design, build, and improve said robots. Companies will compete to create the newest, fastest, most innovative robot. Technicians will service the robots. Engineers would design the robots. Marketing teams would advertise the newest, greatest robot. Business owners would run the business associated with creating robots. Not to mention, in this utopian (dystopian?) world, there would still be demand for chef-made meals (I mean this already exists... would you rather eat ultra processed foods or a freshly made meal?), entertainment, and many other services provided by humans.

Now, if you want to make the argument that AI will speed up inequality, I can understand that position. Those that own the AI companies have a lot to gain and I am open to that argument. But the argument that as AI progresses, more and more people are just gonna go home and twiddle their thumbs all day cause they got nothing to do is simply not based on any historical precedent. Millions of jobs have gone obsolete in the past, and millions of jobs will continue to be replaced. There will be hiccups, but as long as the human race has the drive to innovate and progress, there will always be jobs.",705,511,1708274634,
Is this the last presidential election in US history that won't be dominated by the issue of reorganizing society as free-market human jobs disappear to automation?,"[Uber is partnering with Chinese firm BYD to buy 100,000 robotaxis, and launching them in Abu Dhabi and Singapore](https://cnevpost.com/2024/09/26/weride-to-offer-robotaxis-on-uber/). Put another way, Uber & BYD are about to make 100,000 taxi drivers in Abu Dhabi and Singapore unemployed. In four years' time, it is likely we will be talking about millions of driving jobs, and all over the world, as we rapidly move to all human driving jobs disappearing forever.

Although we don't know how the future of AI and robotics automation is going to play out, we can foresee that there will be significant milestones. When the population in Western countries realizes that all driving jobs (taxis, truckers, etc) are going/gone forever, it will be one of those.  This will be at the same time call center, customer support, admin, paralegal, etc, etc and many other white-collar jobs will be disappearing forever too.

The optimistic scenario is that our free market economies will continue to employ expensive humans and be able to compete with firms where AI & robot employees cost pennies per hour, but many have their doubts about that.

How do you think this issue will first be addressed in future US (or other countries) elections?",406,230,1727364323,
What will the stock market do if ai creates growth in businesses but also makes lots of people lose their jobs due to automation?,"I know nobody has a crystal ball and no one can predict the stock market or the development of AI, but there are some who genuinely believe that AI is going to make A LOT of human jobs not workable in the future and instead these jobs will be done by machines.

The Elephant In the Room with AI art and AI Automation Generally," 

As I see it, the main issue with AI art and AI automation broadly is that we are focused on petty arguments instead of addressing the much larger problem: AI automation is and will continue to create significant conflict in society by allowing corporations to cut costs by replacing and downsizing the workforce.   


This results in an unprecedented concentration of wealth and prosperity in the hands of a few, while millions of people all across the job market suddenly lose their jobs with little opportunity for recovery.   


To mitigate this, it is important that we consider the bigger picture and ensure that the benefits AND profits of AI automation of all kinds are fairly distributed among society rather than just being used to further enrich the wealthy while hurting the working class.  


The argument that ""we can use the technology too!"" is not sufficient. Most individuals will never have the resources to leverage AI to the same extent as corporations, so access alone still puts most people at a disadvantage. Even if individuals are able to access and use the technology, unless we make significant changes, the result will likely be a more unequal society facing a deep existential crisis.",165,334,1672165951,

"Ultimate Guide for Building a Startup with ChatGPT Prompts, from Scratch (free, no ads/sign-ups)","**Disclaimer: all links below are free, no ads, no sign-up required & no donation button.**

Hi all! I'm back building you free prompt libraries to solve future-world problems, and this time, I wanted to provide amazing prompts & the flow to create entire SaaS companies using ChatGPT.

Many people online have built small startups using the concept of HustleGPT, and though they share their journeys, hardly any show the prompts they discover along the way.

I know some people in this sub have asked, ""Can I even make money with this?"", ""should I learn how to program first or use AI?"" the answer depends on you. But if you're willing to put in the hours to realize an idea, then you can do absolutely *anything*.

This is an example of how you can use these prompts with your own variables:

[Ask ChatGPT to Extract important details from a product page](https://preview.redd.it/vsx41mgc1vsa1.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=086520a5f743881a9e14b2b5f4e3b6a9f9885f9c)

I've created prompt libraries for each step of the process (backend, front-end, automation & marketing)

Before you start building anything, I recommend learning the basic concepts of programming and what it even is.

Here we go.

# Building the front-end

All front-end projects (which can do more than show text & pictures) use Javascript, but usually utilize frameworks to streamline the process of handling data well.

I've also categorized several prompt libraries per framework (which you can choose to use) here:

[HTML/CSS Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/html-css-developers) ????

[Tailwind CSS](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/tailwind-css-developers) ????
[Bootstrap Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/bootstrap-developers) ??

[JavaScript Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/javascript-developers) ??

[React Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/react-developers) ????
[Angular Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/angular-developers) ??
 ??Vue.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/vue-js-developers) ????
[Svelte Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/svelte-developers) ????
[Ember.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-frontend-development-jobs-prompt-library/ember-js-developers)

# Building the back-end

The most common back-end frameworks are Node.js, Django, Laravel, etc., so I have made sure to include framework-specific pages for each step.

Here they are:

[Node.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/node-js-developers) ??

[Express.js Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/express-js-developers) ??

[Ruby on Rails Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/ruby-on-rails-developers) ??

[Django Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/django-developers) ??

[Flask Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/flask-developers) ??

[PHP Laravel Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/php-laravel-developers) ??

[Firebase Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-backend-development-jobs-prompt-library/firebase-developers)

Okay, so now you have the back-end to send data to the front end, but where do you get data? You create some!

# Creating Data with Python Automation

Python is one of the easiest libraries to learn, especially for automating monotonous tasks, collecting data, etc.

I've even seen entire SaaS apps created based on a simple automation script, scaled for thousands/millions of people. An example is a service that sends you a notification *as soon* as a product you want goes on sale. (yes, the prompt for that script is included below!)

Here, the AI script prompts are categorized by the intent of what you want to do.

[Web Scraping Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/web-scraping) ??

[Data Processing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/data-processing-experts) ??

[Task Automation & Scheduling Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/task-automation-scheduling) ??

[API Development & Integration Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/api-development-integration) ??

[GUI Automation & Testing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/gui-automation-testing) ??

[Networking & System Administration Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-python-automation-jobs-prompt-library/networking-system-administration)

*P.S. You don't have to work with complex structures. You can start by creating simple CSVs with Python, reading them in Node.js, and sending them to the front-end as simple values.*

*P.P.S. ChatGPT is* ***really*** *good at coding these types of things.*

# Marketing your product (Getting your first users)

Okay, now you've built a working, amazing app/startup with ChatGPT, profit?

Not quite, you need to market it. You don't have to spend thousands, or even a *cent* to employ a great SEO marketing strategy.

Say you create an app that checks online product prices. You wouldn't target people who search ""online notifications"". You would be more specific and target ""get notifications for online products when they go on sale,"" which is a long-tail keyword, and is usually easier to rank for as a new site.

Here are the prompt libraries for SaaS Marketing:

[Keyword Research & Analysis Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/keyword-research-analysis) ??

[Long-tail Keyword Research Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/long-tail-keyword-research) ??

[Competitor Analysis & Content Gap Assessment Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/competitor-analysis-content-gap-assessment) ??

[SEO-Optimized Content Creation Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/seo-optimized-content-creation) ??

[Internal & External Linking Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/internal-external-linking) ??

[On-Page SEO Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/on-page-seo) ??

[Content Promotion Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-promotion) 

[Content Analytics & Performance Tracking Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-analytics-performance-tracking) ??

[Content Updating & Refreshing Prompts](https://hero.page/samir/ai-prompts-for-saas-startups-jobs-prompt-library/content-updating-refreshing)

I am physically unable to explain every SEO tactic out there, but the internet is a wonderful place to learn.

Some of these prompts need your further customization to do what you want them to, but they should provide a pretty good basis for the beginning of your journey :)

"28, quit my job as PM to follow my dream. My plan: no more fancy SaaS. Just boring niches, hyper-automation, and $1.7k/month to stay in the game","Last week I turned 28 years old. I quit my job as a Product Manager to follow my lifelong dream of building my own business. Here my plan for 2025:

\-**Grow Personal Brand**. Tech/Product skills are no longer a competitive advantage in the AI era. Products will be built with one prompt and SaaS market will become overcrowded. Trust is the new competitive advantage. A loyal, engaged audience will give founders an edge. I?檒l be very active on X, LinkedIn, and Reddit.

\-**Start with traction, not complexity**. SaaS is no easy game, I built many apps that no one ever used (not even myself). In the last month, I started a directory as a side-project (3k monthly visits).聽Next steps: fully automate the directory. From data sourcing to curation. I plan to create a 100% automated business that can be leveraged in other projects.

\-**Make other SMEs hyperproductive**. Big corporations are integrating AI while SMEs are stuck. The gap is widening, and those who do not adapt will be left out of the game. As with my directory, I will help other businesses increase their degree of automation.聽

*Key aspects:*

**-Bootstrap.** I aim for growth funded by customers. I want full control over my company's destiny and my freedom as a founder.

\-**Go hyper-niche**. The AI market will split into two main types: saturated generic tools (chatbots, content generators, etc) and unstable apps built by non-techies. The sweet spot is the ?渦nsexy middle?? Niches too narrow for mass-market AI but too complex for amateur automation. My plan: Partner with SMEs to identify these under-automated workflows, and turn insights into specialized tools. Start with custom solutions, and end with scalable products.

\-**Automate**. **Automate**. **Automate**. Repetitive tasks are profit leaks waiting to be plugged (data scraping, customer onboarding, inventory updates). You can easily get a 20% productivity increase by gathering unstructured data, feeding this data to an LLM, and acting on the output. I?檒l automate my internal workflows so that I can focus on what i can do best as human: strategy, creativity and relationships.

\-**Long-term view & consistency**. I?檝e launched 10 side projects in 10 years. All failed. A key success factor will be staying long enough in the game and launching different products until one of them succeeds. I currently need around $1700 monthly to keep my current lifestyle.聽 My first milestone: hit $1,700/month in revenue to fund infinite iteration.",23,36,1737978636,

"Just turned 31, jobless, still living with my parents, deadline to get a job by March 1st.","Hey everyone, I?檓 feeling pretty lost and could really use some advice. Here?檚 my situation:

I?檓 a 31-year-old guy with a B.A. in animation, where I learned 3D modeling and some programming. I graduated right around the pandemic, which made job hunting in my field nearly impossible. I ended up working as a call center customer service rep (WFH) for about a year and a half.

Then I jumped on the ?渓earn to code??wave and started studying web development. But now, with AI automating a lot of front-end work and the job market being flooded?攅ven CS grads are struggling?擨?檓 realizing my chances of landing a dev job quickly are slim.

I?檝e been living like a hermit for years, barely interacting with the outside world, and it?檚 taken a toll on my mental health and social skills. I want to get out, make money, learn, grow, and even help my parents financially. But the problem is that I have no clear direction.

To make things worse, my parents have given me a final deadline - I need to get a job by March (just two weeks away). Ideally, I want a job that pays at least $20/hr (about $40K/year in TX), has growth potential, and helps me develop a useful skill.

Right now, I?檓 considering two paths:

* IT Help Desk: My degree, web dev studies, and call center experience might make this a good fit. I don?檛 have certs yet, but I?檝e heard people get hired without them.
* Cook: I love cooking and am a decent home cook. The idea of working in a kitchen, learning new recipes, and being around people excites me. But I?檓 not sure how realistic it is to get into the field quickly.

I only have two weeks, so I don?檛 know if either of these options is realistic, or if there?檚 something better I should consider based on my background. Any advice? I?檇 really appreciate any insights.",546,859,1739556400,
My passive income streams,"I?檓 going to talk about my passive income streams that are currently working for me.  This is my way to kick this group off in 2025 where we all share information to help each other.


Before I do that, let me define what I view as passive income. Passive income is money you make without much work or upkeep. It usually requires an upfront investment of time and/or money, but little to nothing to maintain it.

With that said, let?檚 get down to it; when helpful I?檒l talk about what investment I have in the project, or any ongoing maintenance.

1. Dividend stocks/mutual funds: I am slowly growing my portfolio of dividend stocks & mutual funds. This requires upfront investment of time to research and obviously money. But let me talk about where I get some of the money from: once a month, when all bills are paid off, I open my bank account and round it off. If I have $x,186.90 I toss $86.90 into my stock account. I let it add up, then I buy stocks with it. 
2. KDP: I write books published via kdp. Now so many scream about paying for advertising and such, but I don?檛 do anything with the majority of my books(those books I consider more of a side hustle), just rely on proper keyword research and such before publishing. In fact my best seller book(actually have the badge for best seller in category) is not linked on one of my websites, no other marketing or advertising, and it makes several hundred every month on avg. The books are fully written by me, so they take some time. I design the covers in photoshop elements and in KDPs own cover program. This is a heavy investment of time. This is not just a bulk numbers game like many on YT promote with their softwares, sure for every book I have that sells, I have many that never sell a single one, but proper niche research helps, and my trick is once I find a niche that gets me sales, I will keep putting books out in the niche for awhile, hoping to capture more of that niche?檚 money.
3. Websites: I have several websites on automation. So here is what I do, I buy 100+ pieces pre-used content(from niche relevant defunct sites), spin it with AI, batch run a bunch of downloaded images through photoshop, then pay someone on fiver to mass schedule the posts for me, following a basic mix of templates I setup. All in costs me around $350, about 2 hours in time, and then it posts for just over a year straight for me(2posts per week), each one is then automatically posted to social media(plus dropped into a scheduler for later reposting). Hosting, subscriptions, and apps costs me around $45 per website(running multiple websites spreads the costs out). So all in, I?檓 around $400yr in costs, and a couple hours. I have ads, affiliate links, sell digital products. on average my sites make  $500 average per yr(after expenses). Not making it rich, but a couple sites making a little is easier than a single site making it huge.
4. Stock photo sales: I love taking photos, I will grab the best for myself and put it aside, then batch process some photos(if you know how to take a good photo and it is just for stock, it can be automated), and upload to various stock photo sites. The time is all over the board, sometimes an hour sometimes multiple hours, as I sift through photos, but once they are on the site(s) they can perpetually make money, about a month ago I had a photo sell that I took 9yrs ago. no work since I took it, so I?檒l take the passive income. This is a post and forget method, just let the sites sell my photos, as they are financially motivated to make sales.
5. Sell courses(no not like how to make passive income scam stuff, lol, I don?檛 have one of those) my day job is in a field that requires government regulation compliance, multiple agencies. So I make courses for people to understand them, then post them to Udemy. I don?檛 do marketing besides posting to any relevant websites that I own, otherwise I rely on the website to make me sales. The time it takes to make these is incalculable, as many of them are just rebranded trainings I have made for work, then recording, editing, and such. So maybe 4-5 hours.
6. Digital files: these could be forms, excel macros, PowerPoint templates. I make them and sell them on a few different sites, all my marketing is just posting on any relevant websites I have. These don?檛 take me much time, as I am often just repurposing files from my day job.

These are the ways I currently make passive income. The biggest thing is I primarily build an ecosystem for a majority of my products, if I build a course on how to start a company(LLC filing, EIN setup, and such), then I?檒l have some books on such maybe about permitting or regulations, maybe a website dedicated to setting up a small business, my digital files might be related to them, and such. Maybe I take stock photos for a small business(processes, machinery, production, and such)- since I can often gain access to such places from friends, family, and my day job. 
By doing it this way, I try to keep a customer in my ecosystem, allowing me to make multiple sources of income from them.

None of these will let me retire tomorrow, or even by the end of this year, but as I push my profits from my passive income streams into buying dividend stocks, I look forward to increasing my less work passive income streams.


TLDR: my passive income streams and no, I?檓 not selling you a course or sharing ultra specifics but will help offer some guidance.",1359,190,1735757282,

I figured it out! Trump/Project 2025 is the distraction!! ELON MUSK IS THE ENDGAME!!!,"WE HAVE TO REFOCUS OUR EFFORTS TO ELON MUSK NOW!!!!

100% EFFORTS TOWARDS ELON AND DOGE 

HERE IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE DONT!!!


1. Government Spending Control ??Mass Defunding of Social Services

Extreme Scenario: Musk Uses Treasury Control to Gut Social Security & Medicare
	??How It Could Happen:
	??Musk, under the pretense of ?済overnment efficiency,??declares that Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable.
	??He delays or restricts payments to retirees, disabled individuals, and low-income families, citing fraud or inefficiency.
	??Government programs like food stamps (SNAP), Medicaid, and federal unemployment insurance are defunded.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??Seniors left without Social Security payments?攆orcing many into extreme poverty.
	??Millions lose healthcare access as Medicaid and Medicare collapse.
	??Increase in homelessness & hunger as millions dependent on federal aid lose critical support.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has repeatedly opposed government handouts and favors self-reliance and automation.
	??By gutting welfare and social programs, he could force Americans to turn to privatized services?攚hich could conveniently be offered by Musk-controlled companies.






2. Market Manipulation ??Artificial Economic Collapse for Personal Gain

Extreme Scenario: Musk Uses Treasury Access to Engineer a Stock Market Crash & Profit from It
	??How It Could Happen:
	??Musk delays payments on U.S. debt obligations, triggering a loss of confidence in Treasury bonds.
	??Interest rates spike, and financial markets panic, causing stocks to crash.
	??Musk and his allies short the market, making billions off the collapse while the average American?檚 401(k) and savings are wiped out.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??Mass unemployment as companies cut jobs due to the economic crash.
	??Retirement funds are decimated, leaving millions with nothing to retire on.
	??Home foreclosures surge as interest rates skyrocket.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has used social media to manipulate markets before (Dogecoin, Tesla stock, Twitter acquisition).
	??If he directly controls Treasury payments, he could trigger a controlled financial meltdown and personally benefit by shorting key assets.




3. Privatization of Government ??Total Replacement of Federal Agencies with Musk-Owned Services

Extreme Scenario: Musk Shuts Down Federal Agencies & Replaces Them with His Own Companies
	??How It Could Happen:
	??Essential government services (such as USPS, FEMA, the Department of Energy, and NASA) are shut down or stripped of funding.
	??Musk privatizes space defense, military logistics, transportation, and AI governance, forcing the government to become dependent on SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??Government services become pay-to-play?攏o more free postal service, emergency relief, or low-cost energy programs.
	??Mass layoffs of government workers, who are replaced by AI automation or private contractors.
	??Lack of accountability?攆ederal agencies exist to serve citizens, but Musk?檚 companies would prioritize profit over public welfare.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has repeatedly expressed anti-government sentiments, seeing bureaucracies as inefficient.
	??If he has direct control over Treasury payments, he could strangle government funding and force reliance on his corporate alternatives.




4. AI-Driven Governance ??A Total Surveillance State Powered by Musk?檚 AI

Extreme Scenario: Musk Implements AI-Based Social Credit System
	??How It Could Happen:
	??Using financial data from the Treasury, Musk creates a real-time scoring system that determines access to government benefits, loans, and even jobs based on behavior.
	??AI monitors Twitter (X) activity, spending habits, and biometric data (via Neuralink/Starlink) to track and control individuals in real time.
	??Those with low scores (e.g., government critics, activists, union members) face restricted financial access, job loss, or worse.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??Loss of personal freedom?攅very citizen?檚 financial and online behavior is tracked.
	??Government critics & journalists targeted?擜I-based censorship limits opposition voices.
	??AI-powered discrimination?攁utomated systems control who gets loans, jobs, healthcare, and benefits.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has openly supported AI governance and mass data tracking (Starlink, Neuralink, X AI).
	??Treasury access gives him the power to connect financial control with AI-based social monitoring.



5. Foreign Policy Disruption ??Shutting Down USAID & Collapsing U.S. Global Influence

Extreme Scenario: Musk Defunds Foreign Aid & Allows China/Russia to Expand Influence
	??How It Could Happen:
	??USAID and U.S. diplomatic support programs are completely shut down, eliminating disaster relief, global vaccination efforts, and humanitarian aid.
	??China and Russia fill the void, expanding their economic and political influence.
	??U.S. allies are left without critical support, leading to a geopolitical power shift away from the U.S.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??Massive loss of U.S. global influence, making America less powerful on the world stage.
	??Weaker international trade deals, leading to higher consumer prices and reduced exports.
	??Greater security threats?攚ithout U.S. intervention, authoritarian regimes expand unchecked.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has prioritized his own global business interests over national security (e.g., Starlink deals with adversaries).
	??Weakening U.S. soft power allows Musk?檚 companies to fill the gaps, controlling global infrastructure rather than governments.





6. Monetary & Currency Shifts ??Eliminating the U.S. Dollar in Favor of a Private Digital Currency

Extreme Scenario: Musk Phases Out the U.S. Dollar & Replaces It with Starlink Digital Currency
	??How It Could Happen:
	??Treasury payments are converted into a crypto-based system run by Musk, bypassing traditional banks.
	??The U.S. dollar rapidly loses value, leading to hyperinflation.
	??The Federal Reserve loses control of monetary policy, and Musk becomes the de facto central banker.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??Loss of financial stability?攔etirement savings and wages devalue overnight.
	??Hyperinflation destroys purchasing power, making basic goods unaffordable.
	??Banks collapse as traditional financial institutions become obsolete.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has promoted decentralized finance and could push for full economic transition to digital currency controlled by Starlink or Neuralink.
	??This would eliminate financial oversight, giving Musk total control over who can access money and at what value.




7. Corporate-Driven Nationalism ??Replacing Democracy with Technocratic Rule

Extreme Scenario: Musk Becomes a ?淭ech Emperor??by Centralizing Power
	??How It Could Happen:
	??Musk consolidates Treasury, AI governance, and defense contracts under his leadership.
	??Government institutions are dissolved, and a corporate-state model replaces democracy.
	??Laws are determined by algorithms, and only those who align with Musk?檚 vision retain privileges.
	??Biggest Detriment to Americans:
	??End of democratic governance, replaced by a privatized technocracy.
	??Public decision-making is eliminated?攃orporate AI controls all systems.
	??Freedom of speech, voting rights, and financial independence are restricted.
	??Rationale:
	??Musk has spoken about post-government civilization models, and his full control over U.S. financial and governance systems could push America toward tech-based authoritarianism.",1147,152,1738605221,
AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED 1000 JOBS in 24h and got 50 INTERVIEWS!,"After months of applying for jobs with no responses, I was feeling desperate. I realized I wasn?檛 just competing with other candidates?擨 was up against algorithms filtering my resume before a human even saw it. So, I created a bot and published it on GitHub: an AI-powered hack that completely changed things for me. 

- It generates custom CVs that bypass ATS filters.
- Applies to hundreds of jobs while you focus on other things.
- It automatically applies to jobs on your behalf.
- Analyzes your personal info.
- Automatically answers recruiter questions.

In a job market dominated by automation, this hack helps you get past those automated filters. After using it, I finally started getting responses and eventually landed a job. The project has **12,000 stars on GitHub** and over **3,000 people on Telegram** talking about it.

If you?檙e in the same situation, it?檚 worth a try.

"The jobs aren?檛 being replaced by AI, but India","I work as a consultant, specializing in network security, and join my analytics teams when needed. Recently, we have started exploring AI, but it has been more of a ?渂uzzword??than anything else; essentially, we are bundling and rephrasing Python-esque solutions with Microsoft retraining.

This is not what?檚 replacing jobs. What?檚 replacing jobs is the outsourcing to countries like India. Companies all over the United States are cutting positions domestically and replacing those workers with positions in India, ranging from managerial to mid-level and entry-level positions.

I?檒l provide an insight into the salary differences. For instance, a Senior Data Scientist in the US, on average, earns $110,000-160,000 per year depending on experience, company, and location.

In India, a Senior Data Scientist earns ??5,00,000-20,00,000, which converts to roughly $19,000-24,000 per year depending on experience, company, and location.

There is a high turnover rate with positions in India, despite the large workforce. However, there?檚 little to no collaboration with US teams.

Say what you will, but ?渢he pending recession??is not an excuse for corporations to act this way. Also, this is merely my personal opinion, but it?檚 highly unlikely that we?檒l face a recession of any sort.

**Update:** Thank you all for so many insightful comments. It seems that many of you have been impacted by outsourcing, which includes high-talent jobs.

In combination with outsourcing, which is not a new trend, the introduction of RPA and AI has caused a sort of shift in traditional business operations. Though there is no clear AI solution at the moment and it is merely a buzzword, I believe the plan is already in place. Hence, the current job market many of you are experiencing.

As AI continues to mature and is rolled out, it will reduce the number of jobs available both in the US and in outsourcing countries; more so in the actual outsourcing countries as the reduction has already happened in the US (assumption). It seems that we are in phase one: implement the teams offshore, phase two will be to automate their processes, phase three will be to cut costs by reducing offshore teams.

Despite record profits and revenue growth by many corporations over the last 5-10 years, corporations want to ?渃ut costs.??To me, this is redundant and unnecessary.

I never thought I?檇 say this, but we need to get out there and influence policymakers. Really make it your agenda to push for politicians who will fight against AI in the workplace and outsourcing. Corporations are doing this because they can. **To this point, please do not attempt to push any sort of political propaganda. This is not a political post. I?檝e had to actually waste my own time researching a claim made by a commenter about what one president did and another supposedly undid.** If you choose to, you can find the comment below. Lastly, neither party is doing anything. Corporations seem to be implementing this fast and furiously.

Please be mindful of the working conditions in the outsourcing countries. Oftentimes, they?檙e underpaid, there is much churn, male-dominated hierarchical work cultures and societies, long and overnight work hours. These are boardrooms and executives making decisions and pushing agendas. We?檙e all numbers on a spreadsheet.

If you?檙e currently feeling overwhelmed or in a position where you?檝e lost your job, don?檛 give up. You truly are valuable. Please talk to someone or call/text 988.",1846,527,1696876174,
"A Microsoft employee thinks there may soon be huge deflation in medical costs, as the company is close to commoditizing doctor's expertise & making it cheap and freely available.","[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/15pskoo/i_had_a_several_hour_conversation_with_the/) in r/singularity is very interesting, and is an account of a conversation with a Microsoft employee working on their AI development.

The pertinent bit I'm referring to is - *""He claimed that they were working with the technology from their Nuance (the company) acquisition to develop tools to assist in healthcare diagnosis and automation, and that they had gotten frequency of the model hallucinating down to 1-0.5% of the time, and that remaining major obstacles have to due with liability.*

*If/when they release versions of it for use, they say it will be important to have professionals actually handling the use of the suggested diagnoses and medications to remove the possibility of lawsuits, and while a future bigger role is possible they would need to be backed by medical insurance companies who would only insure them when their risk of malpractice is below that of doctors. Despite the resistance and difficulty, they do think that healthcare will be a major field for so to revolutionize especially because ?渢he US medical system is a big legal cartel, that makes healthcare cheap elsewhere by gouging their R&D costs at home,??and the opportunity to disrupt and streamline that market has big possibilities for innovation and profit especially because ??0% of their job is automatable according to doctors I?檝e talked to,??and resolving rampant administrative bloat with AI may save billions of dollars in burden on patients.""*",2112,470,1692018556,
"My little brother wants to study CS because of my remote job, should I warn him?","My little brother is asking me if he should study computer science because he saw that I had a fully remote tech job with a high salary, traveling the world. He thinks it?檚 the dream career.

But honestly, I?檓 not sure what to tell him.

I worked hard to get where I am, but I feel like even with effort, these kinds of opportunities might not exist in a few years.

# Nemesis Expansion Features

* Send your gibbering, fungal blob-things into enemy empires wearing those novelty glasses with the nose and mustache on them to sabotage your enemies. No one's going to suspect anything. Just act natural and tell them the slime trail is because you have a skin condition.

* Literally just, blow up the fuckin' galaxy because, I dunno, we live in a society or something. We've given up trying to figure out why you want these features and we're not going to ask about what you're doing with them.

* Did you ever hear the tragedy of Emperor Sumon un-Ret The Wise? I thought not. It?檚 not a story the Galactic Council would tell you. It?檚 a Necroid legend. Sumon was an Emperor of the Korr Hegemony, so powerful and so wise he could manipulate the price of alloys on the galactic market to cheese all kinds of achievements. He had such a knowledge of the ship designer meta that he could even keep multiplayer from ever being fun for anyone else in the group. The subreddit is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... kinda bs. He became so powerful??the only thing he was afraid of was his mom telling him he couldn't play Stellaris until he fixed his grades. Which eventually, of course, she did. Unfortunately, he taught his younger sister everything he knew, including his windows password. Ironic. He could give others the power to wipe your entire species out with planet crackers just for the lulz, but not himself.

* Added K-mart star destroyers

# 3.0.0 Free ""Dick"" Features

* Analysts are already saying this is the most free Dick you can get online outside of being a girl with a twitter account.

* Your starfleet officers should no longer go around launching capsules full of detailed information on your physiology, society, territorial extent, government, and military capabilities at every random ship they pass.

* We totally redid how buildings work, again, so you're going to have to relearn the game, again. What do you expect at this point, though? Are you new here?

* Several Technologies have been flagged as ?淚nfrastructure??gateway technologies. We have our top researchers engaged trying to figure out what the hell that means, my lord.

* It's now possible to produce the good metal and ipods within your actual city districts, instead of forcing all global manufacturing on a planet of billions to take place in a single building on the outskirts of your population centers.

* Due to a union dispute, you can no longer build a Factory and a Forge on the same planet.

* Planets now have a carrying capacity, which models the fact that at a certain point of overpopulation people stop having so many babies because the air outside tastes like batteries, dating apps are literally hell, it's easier to just buy a dakimakura.

* Reduced the sex drive of all pops in very large empires to make the late game actually playable on PCs that haven't been enhanced with Fallen Empire technology.

* Fresh colony worlds will now have increased stability, amenities, and happiness as the people enjoy their short-lived freedom, space whiskey, and space prostitution until the space railroad barons and the volatile mote speculators move in and kill all the old, rugged frontier heroes in a big tragic gunfight or something, signaling the end of a romantic era that will be commemorated in melodramatic holofilms for generations to come.

* Spawning Pools now properly spawn pops on their own instead of just serving as a convenient hook-up spot for your drones.

* The level of overpopulation required for your pops to give up and buy a dakimakura has been reduced.

* Reworked the manual resettlement UI to make it more or less usable.

* Added a quality of life feature where you can tell your scientists to just work on whatever sounds neat to them.

* Empires will now be required to submit a letter of resignation or introduce themselves and give one cool fact about them when leaving/joining the Galactic Community.

* You can now [choose the form of the destructor](https://imgur.com/a/a8WEXiX).

* Added a setting to turn off edge scrolling, fucking finally.

* New factions-themed colony event chain, ?淢anifest Destiny?? so you can call upon the propaganda of your pre-interstellar past to explain how chasing the xenos out of their ancient homelands so you can build a Wal Mart is good, actually.

# Balance

* Homeworlds will on average be about 10% thicccer

* Unemployed pops now have a 10% chance every month to migrate to a better, eligible planet if there is one. The remaining 90% will just buy more dakimakuras and ask mom when dinner will be ready.

* Pops in empires with the Greater Than Ourselves civic will be more likely to be kicked out of the house and told to go find a job on the frontier.

* Having a Transit Hub on your starbase will increase the chances that local pops will be kicked out of the house because they don't even have the excuse that they can't afford a shuttle.

* Manual resettlement now has an influence cost because you have to win an argument with Trevor, who assures you that his neo-darkwave solo project is gonna blow up on bandcamp soon and he just needs like six more months to work with this marketing guy and you're literally ruining his life.

* Manually resettling the last pop on a planet now has a significant Influence surcharge because you know those guys are probably in a cave somewhere and have lots of guns and don't believe in taxes.

* Higher strata pops will now accept a normie job twice as quickly as we got them to understand that the other option is the airlock.

* Pops born on a shattered ring will no longer be willing to debase themselves and live on a fucking sphere. I mean, seriously? Look at this thing. It's *convex* for gods' sake!

* Added a warning that lithoids and ring worlds aren't a good combo but, ya know, whatever, we're not gonna tell you how to live your life.

* Machine empires living on habitats have realized that they probably need to do maintenance on said habitat.

* You no longer have to consult a 5-D org chart to figure out which jobs your robots are allowed to have.

* Pops in democracies will now have a higher rate of automatic resettlement because they want to go pursue a music career in Neo-New Los Angeles in the Sirius system and if you don't support their dream then you probably never loved them anyway!

* Oligarchies now grant bonus influence from happy factions since you don't really have to worry about what the poors think.

* Dictators are now better at dealing with empire sprawl, as you can always shoot anyone who complains.

* Gestalt Consciousnesses will be harder to spy on. The operative codenamed ""Bugsnax"" apparently wasn't successful with his, ""How do you do, fellow drones?"" strategy and we believe his biological material is now part of a waste disposal orifice. We're gonna tell his family it was a mining accident.

* Enigmatic Engineering will now cause enemy spies trying to steal your technology to [automatically fail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfiQYRn7fBg).

* Criminal Syndicates will now be better at spying. Yeah, those voice-activated home assistants they sold you are definitely spying on you for the megacorp. You probably knew that already but you bought it anyway, didn't you? I mean, they already saw all those dakimakuras in your purchase history because they have a monopoly on holonet shopping, so at this point, why even bother?

* The Universal Compatibility tradition now also grants 1 additional Envoy and we're going to collectively agree not to think too hard about why.

* The Influence cost for using Favors in the Galactic Community has been reduced from 25 to 10, as we felt that was too high a barrier to the kind of rampant corruption that regularly flourishes in supranational organizations.

* The galaxy is reporting an overall increased effectiveness of Five Year Plans, as the new espionage system makes it easier to hide any evidence to the contrary.

* Pops with decent or better living conditions will now buy significantly more meaningless bullshit, boosting your trade income.

* The Food Processing Center, Mineral Purification Hub, and Energy Nexus buildings now create jobs instead of serving as purely symbolic monuments to inspire productivity.

* Residents of arcologies should no longer demand to be hopped up on exotic gases 24/7.

* The science fairs held to determine the new leader of a science federation will now be more scientific.

* Enclave stations should no longer go into a catastrophic failure state if someone spills their space coffee on one of the mainfraimes.

* It's now possible to purge multiple pops per month by stacking modifiers because we recognize it can get kind of tedious having to wipe out so many sentient beings. You have other stuff to do today.

* Outposts are now equipped with basic sensors so you don't have to ask Ensign Valdez what he sees out the port window like this is a fucking schooner or something.

* You're going to need to dump even more potatoes into the clone vats to keep them working at full efficiency.

* Cloning lithoids now takes longer than cloning squishies. There are chisels involved and it's not pretty.

* Cloning necroids takes much, much longer than cloning other species because you have to wait for someone to have enough blood potency to animate the new initiate and depending on how much xp the storyteller is giving out, that can take months.

* Terravores will now finish their entire dinner.

* Centers of Elevation will no longer create so many Necrophytes that you're left without any worms left to subjugate, because at that point you're just a regular empire but with more brooding and 90s Hot Topic aesthetics.

* Everyone will stop caring about your Prosperous Unification after about 10 years when they realize this just means their vote matters even less than it used to and there are still going to be wars, but it's with killer goddamn space bugs now.

# Automation

* Continuing our never-ending mission to make  Planetary and Sector automation AI at least slightly less incompetent

* Planetary AI should no longer invest billions expanding on industries for which there are no available workers to employ

* Planetary AI should no longer feel like it needs to spend money on *something* when everything on the planet is going perfectly fine just because they were bored and needed a thing to do.

* Sector AI designations now actually work.

* Sector AI in a custodian empire will no longer forget to build organic sanctuaries and then become very confused by all the naked, starving bio-trophies trying to break into their main processing facility with rocks and sticks.

# UI

* MP games now show an icon in front of the player that paused so you can yell at them more easily.

# AI

* The AI should now better understand what a building that gives a % bonus for a resource does. I don't know what they thought this meant previously.

* AI will now buy loot boxes from the Caravaneers, beginning the grand transition to the games industry's final form: bots spending other people's money on gacha, creating a permanent revenue stream in which we don't have to worry about what human players actually want ever again.

* AI federation leaders should no longer decide that the federation fleet should be like, all picket ships or something stupid like that.

* AI should no longer interpret a massive defeat as a sign that they should really cut back on the military budget.

# Bugfixes

* Many improvements to tooltips giving reasons why a certain species right is unavailable to you, which is very generous of us given that you should be happy with the answer, ""You're a filthy xeno. That's why.""

* Pops that aren't allowed in the military can no longer dress up as a different species to learn how to become a soldier from Donny Osmond against all cultural norms.

* You can no longer appoint nerve-stapled pops to officer positions, even though being completely braindead doesn't seem to normally be a disqualification from serving on the general staff.

* Caravaneers can no longer sell you monke

* Removed a case where you could finish a Colossus without a weapon on it, stand back, and be like, ""Alright... what the fuck is this thing for again?""

* Synthetically Ascended empires can now successfully block the Ghost Signal, which means they now have more features than Discord.

* Random assholes with no planets should no longer be able to declare themselves Successors of the Great Khan.

* Terraforming should no longer accidentally cause planets to expand to be larger than the black hole at the center of the galaxy.

* Removed a case where your pops would still end up banging aliens even if you explicitly set up the game rules to stop them from doing this. And, to be honest, they're probably going to still find a way to do it anyway. But we can at least say we tried.

* Sending a mission to uplift the monke should no longer result in them getting mad, tipping the monolith over, and using it as a shiny toilet.

* Can no longer use your diplomats to neg other empires into liking you.

* You can no longer reap the political capital from ignoring a galactic resolution to satisfy your people and then immediately take steps to do the opposite of what you said you would do, making the game less realistic.

* Local authorities will no longer try to maintain the corpse-strewn Subterranean Contact Zone as a tourist attraction after you've invaded and wiped out their entire civilization.

* A federation member can no longer storm out of the federation during a leadership challenge, invoking an obscure clause that technically makes them president for life despite no longer being a member or able to pass any resolutions.

* The starting leader of a democracy or oligarchy will no longer vanish forever, when the galaxy needed him most, after his term is over. He'll instead become a governor.

* Every truce tooltip will now tell you when the truce ends, because why else would you be looking at a truce tooltip?

* Fixed an error message from killing too many Tiyanki at once, because you should be allowed to massacre as many space whales as you want without getting a bunch of shit from VIR about it.

* You'll no longer get automatically called into a war because you didn't hear your phone ringing.

* Fixed the ship name for the Shard Dragon being $NAME_Grand_Dragon$. His short-lived rap career was met with critical derision and he'd rather not talk about it any more.

* Conquered pre-FTL pops should no longer want to return to monke

* You can no longer build another megastructure in a system where you already have a mega shipyard. Which is kinda crazy, if you think about it. Like, this is outer space we're talking about. How big is that shipyard?

* The Great Khan should no longer laugh so defiantly in the face of death that he comes back to life twice the first time you kill him.

* lol dick

"Indian Job Market is seeing a unique trend. On the employment side we often see reports about rise in unemployment, lack of quality jobs and opportunity but on the other...? ","Hello everyone, I?檇 like to share some insights and ask for your thoughts.

We?檙e building a discussion platform exclusively for India, and during our beta testing, we conducted a small study on the Indian job market and the aspirations of youth. Here?檚 what we found:

1. Many youths feel disheartened by the lack of quality jobs and the insecurity in the private sector.
2. Women expressed disappointment with the quality of workspaces and the lack of adequate benefits.
3. We noticed trends of Underemployment in terms of quality pay and additional perks still remains a significant issue across many sectors.

But On the brighter side, we noticed booming industries with immense potential:

AI, Automation, and Robotics. 
Healthcare Tech. 
Fintech. 
Renewable Energy. 
Gaming Technology. 
Spacetech. 
Semiconductors. 

These industries are not only growing but few of them are also labour-intensive, offering opportunities for job security and long-term careers.

Do you think the rise of these industries can truly transform India?檚 job market and create opportunities in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and bring an end to the issue of unemployment?

Nokia $NOK Debunking common myths. And a look at recent news.,"Nokia $NOK Debunking common myths. And a look at recent news.

As a long on Nokia, I have been lurking this sub and I see a lot of the same misconceptions about Nokia and well, I believe its time for me to bring some clarity to the reality that is $NOK

**Myth #1 Nokia is a phone company.**

This is wrong, Nokia is not a phone company. They sold their phone business to Microsoft back in 2013 for over 7 billion dollars, later it was sold by Microsoft to HMD for 350 million dollars in 2016, who currently makes the phones. Nokia just gets royalties for the use of their name.

**Myth #4 Nokia is losing market share due to competition**

While yes, there is strong competition in the 5G market, Huawei the global leader, is facing bans across the United States and Europe, ZTE who makes up a small fraction of the market share is also seeing geopolitical pressure. Current estimates of market share show the following Huawei 28.5% Ericsson 26.5% Nokia 22% Samsung 8.5% ZTE 5% and others 9.5%.

Here is an updated list on each countries stance on Huawei and ZTE. The list is growing as more and more countries decide to venture away from Chinese telecommunication equipment.

The only way for the civilisation to keep advancing is either guaranteed basic income or genocide,"Dealing with incompetent people terrible at doing their pretty simple and straightforward job and listening to other people's similar accounts made me realise this.

The world becomes more and more complex. Routine work keeps getting automated, the remaining jobs either become more intelligence-heavy or offer less pay.

But human intelligence stays the same. There are even studies that claim that, raw intelligence and brain volume wise, cavemen might've been better equipped, and there's [evidence](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220503-why-human-brains-were-bigger-3000-years-ago) that humans had bigger brains thousands of years ago compared to the brain size of modern humans. So we're definitely not getting smarter as a species.

So where will all the people with less then sufficient intelligence go? Currently there are still plenty of low-grade blue collar and white collar roles which require very little qualification. And when a clerk responsible for managing your rental or dealing with your billing messes up details of your request or doesn't pass crucial information to the relevant counterparties, we have to deal with it because the company hiring those people doesn't offer pay high enough to attract people smart enough to do the job right. So we begrudgingly accept the consequences.

But eventually free market and competition it's based on will force such companies to modernise, by either hiring less but smarter people or by automating their jobs (AI please come save us!).

Where will those less then sufficiently smart people go? Some will pivot and take new niches, from doing dumb but highly physical work our bodies are still better equipped for (till Boston Dynamics and Skynet take over that niche too) to pimping themselves out on OF and the like (till sex dolls and AI girlfriends take over that as well).

The rest will just become permanently unemployed.

And this is where the problem becomes universal. Because a large masse of people unable to produce any economic product but having voting rights becomes a factor of destabilisation and a rich soil for populist politicians. One might argue that it's already happening now.

To deal with that, governments would have basically three options.

Option 1 - Guaranteed employment. This is the next step of existing job market protectionist measures, when for most roles you can't hire a foreigner unless you've demonstrated sufficient effort trying to hire a local citizen. The next step would be forcing companies to hire humans and only resort to role automation if no human was capable of doing the job. This will stall economic progress and will push back democratic countries compared to more authoritarian ones which put economic efficiency above social responsibilities. So it cannot be a sustainable long term option.

Option 2 - Guaranteed basic income. Like the experiment Switzerland tried to conduct in 2016 but whose people voted against. This way, people are given some basic amount of money for free, so that they can continue to exist without having to work. The effect this would have on a country's economy and social structure is unclear and up to debate. Options on the table may vary from total happiness and bliss to segregation based on income, social tension and eventually civil war. But, assuming that there are sufficient measures to keep people on basic income happy enough and sufficient funds generated by the rest of the society to keep the system balanced, this could be a sustainable long term option.

Option 3 - Genocide. Like Duterte-era ""war on drugs"" in the Philippines, but scaled to ""war on stupidity"". If you cannot make yourself employed, welcome to a concentration camp style PIP, so that you either upskill or get rekt. Sounds dystopian enough to never be possible, but examples of the Philippines and North Korea show that nothing is impossible. Although I don't really see this happen in the Western world, not explicitly at least. A more realistic scenario is silent genocide, when social guarantees and services provided by the state are allowed to degrade to a point of nonexistence, and then people just die due to ""natural causes"", it's nobody's fault, everyone smiles, nothing changes. This is however an unstable state, as low quality of life + voting rights would again be enabling populists, which in turn would put out social fires with extra money, so the result is a combination of Option 1 (via trade union class actions) and Option 2 (via taxation and direct aid gimmicks). So, probably not sustainable, unless we all go into a global 1984 mode.

I don't see anything outside these three options/combinations thereof. But happy to reconsider if a compelling alternative is proposed.",320,373,1733330346,

"""Workers are hiding their AI productivity hacks from bosses""","A Wharton professor believes that businesses should motivate their employees to share their individual AI-enhanced productivity hacks, despite the prevalent practice of hiding these tactics due to corporate restrictions.

**Worker's Use of AI and Secrecy**:

* Employees are increasingly using AI tools, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, to boost their personal productivity and manage multiple jobs.
* However, due to strict corporate rules against AI use, these employees often keep their AI usage secret.

**Issues with Corporate Restrictions**:

* Companies tend to ban AI tools because of privacy and legal worries.
* These restrictions result in workers being reluctant to share their AI-driven productivity improvements, fearing potential penalties.
* Despite the bans, employees often find ways to circumvent these rules, like using their personal devices to access AI tools.

**Proposed Incentives for Disclosure**:

* The Wharton professor suggests that companies should incentivize employees to disclose their uses of AI.
* Proposed incentives could include shorter workdays, making the trade-off beneficial for both employees and the organization.

**Anticipated Impact of AI**:

* Generative AI is projected to significantly transform the labor market, particularly affecting white-collar and college-educated workers.
* As per a Goldman Sachs analysis, this technology could potentially affect 300 million full-time jobs and significantly boost global labor productivity.

[About the author](https://www.noahpinion.blog/about).

Summary and evaluation for accuracy generated by language model GPT-4 Turbo:

>Summary  
>  
>The essay discusses the widespread concern among AI technologists that advancements in AI will lead to widespread unemployment and decreased wages due to automation of tasks previously done by humans. It explores the historical context of job evolution from agriculture to services, reflecting on the fear that AI could eventually render human labor obsolete across all sectors. However, the author challenges this notion by introducing the concept of comparative advantage, which suggests that even if AI becomes superior in performing all tasks, humans will still find niches where their labor is preferable due to opportunity costs associated with using AI. The essay argues that constraints like the finite availability of computing power will ensure humans have a comparative advantage in certain tasks. This could lead to a scenario where, even in an AI-dominated future, humans maintain gainful employment and possibly even enjoy higher wages due to the overall increase in societal wealth generated by AI. Nonetheless, the essay acknowledges potential challenges such as inequality, the rapid shifts in job markets, and the theoretical possibility of AI demanding ownership of its production means. The author concludes that while there are economic impacts of AI worth worrying about, the complete obsolescence of human labor is not one of them, urging a reconsideration of fears related to AI and employment based on the principle of comparative advantage.  
>  
>Evaluation for Accuracy  
>  
>The essay presents a thoughtful and well-argued perspective on the potential impacts of AI on the labor market, grounded in economic theories such as comparative advantage and opportunity cost. Its analysis is consistent with known economic principles and provides a plausible counter-narrative to the common dystopian view of AI-induced mass unemployment. The concept of comparative advantage, introduced by David Ricardo in the early 19th century, is accurately described and applied to the context of AI and human labor, illustrating how even superior AI technology might not render human labor obsolete.  
>  
>The historical context of job evolution from agriculture through industrialization to the service economy accurately reflects economic shifts related to technological advancement. This historical perspective supports the argument that society adapts to technological changes by creating new types of jobs and industries.  
>  
>Moreover, the concerns listed about AI - such as inequality, adjustment issues, and the potential for AI to demand ownership of its means of production - align with contemporary discussions among economists and technologists. These considerations indicate that the author is well-informed about the nuanced debates surrounding the future of AI and work.  
>  
>However, it?檚 important to note that while the principle of comparative advantage offers a compelling framework for understanding how human labor might persist in an AI-dominated future, the real-world outcomes will depend on a variety of complex, interacting factors not fully explored in the essay. These include the pace of AI development, governmental policies, societal values, and the adaptability of education systems to new economic realities.  
>  
>Overall, the essay provides an accurate, insightful analysis based on economic theories but should be seen as part of a broader ongoing dialogue about the future of work and society in the age of AI.",14,27,1710816347,
They need us to start getting nasty,"COVID was like a symptom check for the economy?攊t didn?檛 cause all the problems, but it sure exposed them. Prices went nuts because supply chains crumbled, businesses couldn?檛 find workers, and demand shot through the roof. However, even after things ?渘ormalized,??stuff is still expensive.

1锔忊儯 Not enough workers = everything costs more. COVID sped up retirements and reshuffled the job market. Now businesses are scrambling for workers, which means they have to pay more.

CNBC: ChatGPT is already generating savings for companies for coding and to write job descriptions.,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/chatgpt-is-being-used-for-coding-and-to-write-job-descriptions.html

* More than half of the businesses surveyed by ResumeBuilder said they are already using ChatGPT, and half of the firms reported replacing worker tasks with generative AI.
* ChatGPT is being used to do everything from write job descriptions to help assist coders.
* The push to use AI is increasing as companies like Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI continue to invest in the technology.

The recent launch of Google?檚 Bard brought another tech giant into the generative artificial intelligence space, alongside Microsoft?檚 Bing chat and OpenAI?檚 ChatGPT.

But how many business leaders are currently using AI tech in day-to-day operations or plan to?

Based on new research, a lot. Half of the companies ResumeBuilder surveyed in February said they are using ChatGPT; 30% said they plan to do so. The data included 1,000 responses from the ResumeBuilder?檚 network of business leaders.

Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder, said the data might be the tip of the iceberg. Since the survey was completed, more professionals have started using generative AI.

Adopting AI is saving money

Haller said age and the current state of the economy influenced the results. For example, 85% of respondents were under 44 and younger workers are more likely to adopt new technology.

?淚f you?檙e 38, 40 years old, you grew up with technology in your hands,??she said. ?淭his is second nature to you.??
Haller said high adoption also relates to the post-pandemic job market. After expanding during the pandemic, companies are adjusting to a new economy through automation, she said.

?淲e saw ChatGPT replacing jobs in the HR department first, the people writing job descriptions or responding to applicants,??Haller said. ?淚 don?檛 know many people that love writing job descriptions, and I?檝e been in this world for a long time.??
ResumeBuilder collects hiring data to help applicants build cover letters and CVs during their search.

When businesses automate writing tasks, it leaves money available for more strategic areas of the company. According to the data, half the firms implementing AI said they saved $50,000, and a tenth of companies said they had saved $100,000.

The other area where ChatGPT is having an impact is in coding. Haller said companies were using generative AI to speed up coding tasks and using the time and money they saved toward retraining and hiring.

?淚f they can generate code well enough to reduce the labor cost, they can take their code budget and pay developers,??she said. ?淥r better yet, retrain code writers to do the jobs they need to fill.??
She said it is still hard to find senior developers, and every bit counts.

AI is becoming a hot resume item

CEO Praveen Ghanta founded Fraction, a professional services startup to help tech companies find senior developers, and said generative AI is part of his firm?檚 strategy. AI as a skillset is already a resume stand out.

?淲e saw it first on the demand side,??Ghanta said. ?淣ow we?檙e seeing it appear on developer resumes as a skill.??
ResumeBuilder found nine out of 10 responding businesses sought potential employees with ChatGPT experience. One version of ChatGPT as a resume skill is what Ghanta called prompt engineering.

?淔or example, ChatGPT is bad at math,??he said, but candidates could draw on their prompt engineering experience to know what inputs produce the best-generated results. ?淚f you say, ?矻et?檚 do this step by step??in the prompt, its ability to do math word problems skyrockets,??he said.

Ghanta said the idea for Fraction came when he was recruiting for a previous startup and found talent by hiring part-time developers already working at top tech companies. He found that developers with 12 years of experience and AI prompt skills still needed help getting in front of hiring managers.

?淭he currency of the day in hiring hasn?檛 changed, it?檚 a resume,??Ghanta said. ?淗iring managers still want to see that sheet of paper, a PDF, and many developers have really bad resumes.??
They?檙e not writers, he said, and struggle to represent their work experience clearly. His team uses an AI workflow to combat this. Clients speak about their responsibilities to a transcribing bot like Otter.AI, which ChatGPT summarizes into a working resume. With prompt know-how, Ghanta said using AI has become a toolset companies seek.

Will AI replace workers?

With the correct instruction, ChatGPT can write applications, build code, and solve complex math problems. Should employees worry about their jobs? Ghanta said as a founder, he looks at new tech as tools to engage with, and new skills are always an advantage for employers or employees.

?淚 encourage developers to engage and sharpen their skills. These companies make it easy to use their APIs,??he said. ?淔rom a company perspective, adoption can be competitive because this is a new skill. Not everybody is doing this yet.??
There has been a growing concern that generative AI could replace jobs, and perhaps not the ones most expected. A recent study found that while telemarketers top the list of jobs ?渆xposed??to generative AI, roles like professors and sociologists are also at risk.

On the hiring side, 82% of respondents said they had used generative AI for hiring in a recent ResumeBuilder update. Among respondents, 63% said candidates using ChatGPT were more qualified.

?淲hen Photoshop came out, people thought it would replace everything and that they couldn?檛 trust pictures anymore,?欌€?Haller said. ?淪ince the Industrial Revolution, new technology has changed how we work. This is just the next step.??,1756,287,1680964593.0
These tech """"influencers"""" are the reason why you don't have a job in the tech industry""","I've been in the tech market as a Data Scientist in Silicon Valley enough to recognize that at this point, tech ""influencers"" in Youtube, MOOCs, Kaggle, etc. are now the ones preventing entry level applicants from getting their first technical job in the tech industry.

These people give the worst and just purely wrong advice you can imagine in the tech industry and profit off of the naive young applicants who make up majority of the scammer's audience. For instance, in the data field, all these ""experts"" claim that a lifecycle of a data science project in industry ends with heavy Machine learning solutions. Anyone who has successfully derived meaningful value out of data science in their company knows that this is absolutely the wrong approach to project management and project scoping. But the young inexperienced ones listen to these advices when most of these ""experts"" and ""influencers"" haven't worked in the field in a long time.

I don't know if it's fair to mention names, but we all know who these people are: Jo. Tech, S. Raval. These ""influencers"" run down stream to lesser influential people on medium/towardsdatscience.com/etc. who again have little experience in industry themselves but are pumping out garbage content that sounds deceivingly attractive with hot words like ""edge computing"", ""deep reinforcement learning"", when only a tiny fraction in the industry actually uses these tech. I know, working in an AI automation company myself.

So why do they to this? It's painfully clear; they just want to sell courses or make money on medium.  They are only interested in their own brand, they have little of your own interest. How can you tell? How can you distinguish legitimate content from illegitimate content? By this simple trick; if there's something they would lose if their words are found inaccurate, you know it's illegitimate content.

This is what I mean. I mentor Berkeley/Stanford students all the time, being an Alma Mater in there. If my advice to them on finding employment turns out to be wrong, I have little if not nothing to lose. Because I have nothing to gain whether or not my advice turns out to be correct. But that's not the case for these ""influencers"". This is what I mean. If their advice turns out to be wrong, it has implications on their revenue, their branding, their ability to sell courses.

I suppose why I find this so frustrating is that these snake oil salesmen are giving all the wrong advices for their own ridiculous brands and money making schemes which puts young aspirants and their career prospects to jeopardy. They say they're being moral and altruistic and actually caring about the people who are having difficult time getting jobs, when they're just abusing and taking advantage of the na茂vet茅. I experienced this personally, when I wrote something very minor on subreddit long ago about basically how business intuition is very important in the data field, and all these commenters lashed out at me in droves, saying ridiculous things like ""project design"" in a term I apparently made up since they haven't heard of it from the course-peddlers (wat the f?)

These influences have real-life effects. I interview data scientists/analysts all the time for my company, and these applicants basically say/do the same thing that I hear from these influencers, such as applying ML methods to non-ML problems just because it's ""cool"", they took courses on it, etc. It's such a turn off and a clear signal that these people have been taught the wrong things in their MOOCs, self-taught journey.

My suggestion for young applicants is that rather than listening to these ""influencers"" online, reach out to actual Data Scientists/programmers/etc. who have been in the industry for a long time and ask them directly about the market. They're usually happy to dispense advice, which I can guarantee are much more sound and solid.

**Edit: I actually don't mind Tech Lead as much as others here. I know he's had issues with CSDojo and other youtubers. That part sucks. But his rants about the ridiculousness of the tech industry is pretty spot on. I actually don't mind Jo Tech's new videos too, they're pretty funny. But their courses, yea that's the crap I'm talking about. I haven't taken Clement's courses, don't know, but  just be careful about people in general who's more interested in their own brands than you.**

**Andrew Ng, he's interesting I find him both part of the problem and the solution. He's definitely course-peddling obviously and sells the dream to thousands of young data hopefuls when obvious getting DL certifications from Coursera is NOT going to get them a job. Or be actually used at work unless you have a Phd. But Ng's general wisdom on integrating AI to companies in SaaS or manufacturing is extremely valuable.**

**The ones I'm mostly frustrated about are these writers on towards data science or linkedin** **or youtube who have huge influence as a content-promoter but who has never really worked as a Data Scientist. Some of people are like A. Miller, who never actually worked as a Data Scientist, or those who come from Semi-conductor background but somehow call themselves as a Data Scientist. I've also seen interns who've never worked full time giving advice on Data Science. That sh%t is ridiculous.**

What will happen to the stock market if ai creates huge growth in corporations but also makes lots of people lose their jobs due to the automation? ,"I know nobody has a crystal ball and no one can predict the stock market or the development of AI, but there are some who genuinely believe that AI is going to make A LOT of human jobs not workable in the future and instead these jobs will be done by machines. 

My question is, what would happen to the stock market in this scenario? If AI increases productivity and profit margins for pretty much all of its businesses, if it really is that powerful, but the workforce goes down to 20% unemployment for example which is around what it was during the Great Depression, what would happen to the stock market? On one hand you?檝e got huge organisations growing which would make those stocks go up in value normally, but without millions of people putting money in via their pension, 401k etc or simply through retail investing because they no longer have a job, what do people think will happen to the stock market?",10,7,1726364516,
My Husband Wants to Start a Startup in a Few Months ?揑'm pretty worried. What should I expect? I will not promote,"My husband and I recently got our green cards. He?檚 passionate about AI, infrastructure, & automation stuff and wants to start a startup in that space. When I ask him how he plans to do it, he doesn?檛 give me a concrete answer. His plan is to quit his job in July, speak to investors, and figure things out from there. He says he?檚 currently restricted from pursuing it due to work policies, which I believe is true?攂ut I also feel like having a solid plan ahead of time would be better.

I was on an H-4 visa while my husband was on an H-1B (SDE 3) on FAANG for about three years. I just received my employment authorization card, so I can now legally work, though I haven?檛 started yet. Over the past few years, I?檝e been focused on fixing up our house after we bought a fixer-upper, so I don?檛 have much work experience beyond that. Financially, we have some savings and investments, but I plan to start working in May or June to secure health insurance and provide extra financial stability(although it's nowhere comparable to my husband's salary.) 

My husband seems like a smart guy. his performance reviews are always top-tier?攂ut I believe that being a good software engineer and running a business are two different things. I have no clue what to expect from this, and we don?檛 have anyone in our circle who has done this before.

For those of you who?檝e been through the early stages of a startup, what were the biggest challenges you faced? What's the worst thing that we can ever face?  What should I prepare for? My husband is super chill and thinks I?檓 overthinking, but I just want to be realistic because we'll only eat up our savings from this point on even when I'm working full time. It's quite stressful for me to step into unknown territory & fiancial troubles, but I support his decision and will stand by him no matter what. I just need to have my mind prepped ahead.
Thanks in advance for your advice..! 


---
Thank you, everyone, for providing so much advice..! I couldn't respond to everyone, but I really really appreciate all the comments..?槶

To answer some of the questions in the comments:

- We do have a financial cushion for a 3-5 years. I?檝e invested most of the money in stocks, and you never know how the stock market will perform in the future. (We live in HCOL area)

- My husband doesn?檛 care much about financial stability. He is definitely not motivated by money. I know this sounds ridiculous, and we do get into some conflicts about this, but he really doesn?檛 care much about money. The reason for his startup is that he believes in the product and says it will make people?檚 lives easier (at least for the product?檚 users). He says he?檚 been thinking about this idea for years.

So, he?檒l 99.99% quit by July or even earlier. There won?檛 be enough time to finish and test his product by then; he?檒l just go for it. Honestly, he would have quit a long time ago if it weren?檛 for his company sponsoring his H1B visa.

- His plan is for me to work full-time while he tries his startup until we have no money left (literally at the edge of foreclosure). He says he?檒l go back to working in tech at that point.

Thanks again!",199,286,1739826739,

Indian CIOs to Start Budgeting for GenAI in 2025 ??How Will This Impact the IT Job Market?,"According to a new forecast from Gartner, Indian Chief Investment Officers (CIOs) are expected to begin allocating budgets for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) starting in 2025. This marks a shift from experimental GenAI projects to more committed investments. GenAI is predicted to play a significant role in driving productivity gains (up to 18%) and reducing operational costs in the coming years.

One critical impact of GenAI's rise will be on the workforce. IT leaders anticipate that GenAI will replace 3.8% of headcount in 2024, 6.1% in 2025, and 8.2% by 2026, as automation and AI-powered tools begin to take over more routine tasks.

The report also highlights that AI-specific expertise will command a premium, with salaries expected to increase by 5% to 15% over non-AI roles. This trend is likely to accelerate as companies scale up their adoption of AI technology.

Meanwhile, India?檚 IT sector is expected to see a slight increase in spending, with projections of $160 billion in 2025?攁n 11.2% rise from 2024. This uptick will be driven by demand for services like app modernization, cloud, and consulting, with GenAI playing a pivotal role in transforming these areas.

Big IT industry players like Wipro and Infosys have not disclosed their hiring projections for GenAI, but they've acknowledged the growing demand for AI skills.

How do you think the growing reliance on GenAI will impact IT job opportunities in India? Are we ready to shift to AI-driven automation, or will it create job displacement and upskilling challenges?",2,0,1731485243,
"Synopsis: Evergrande, 小rypto and Gamestop links to the financial crash that?檚 afoot.","Evergrande is a Chinese property developer. Late in 2021, they were China's largest bond issuer and the 7th largest property developer in the WORLD.

Fundamentally they create Bucketloads of Chinese Commercial Paper. In July, they started defaulting on interest payments to the bond owners.

The Chinese government has, until now, bailed out Evergrande by offering to pay the interest payments to Chinese citizens, but international bond owners have still not received any interest payments.

The lack of international payments has resulted in the value of those bonds plummeting. Evergrande bonds are arguably worthless due to Evergrande's default on bond payments.

Chinese banks are no longer issuing mortgages to customers who intend to buy property (Ghost Town Apartments) from Evergrand. The Chinese Government has BANNED banks from issuing mortgages on Evergrande properties! The government and banks know what?檚 happening. Evergrande will not be able to keep defaulting on foreign payments; it has imploded, and will eventually explode.

&#x200B;

[Evergrande is down 90&#37; in the period of a year.](https://preview.redd.it/m6txej3ac3z81.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aa4d7372e1f7bf3f3817744ebc014d21b5648f2)

Insiders at Evergrande started selling off their Evergrande stocks and bonds in Feb 2021, months before the company defaulted on payments. They knew it would happen and offloaded the stock to unsuspecting institutions and individuals who thought they were getting a bargain because the stock was at a low of around $2.00 compared to its ATH of $4.00, which was seen in Sep 2020.

Even with this insider knowledge, they still sold at an average loss of 60% ??receiving just $0.40 back for every $1 they had previously invested, causing huge losses. Shockwaves of that massive sell-off are still echoing around the world. The effects blasted through the world's economic markets.

Evergrande is currently valued at $0.16 compared to its $1.57 value last year. It?檚 lost 90% of its share price.

If (when?) Evergrande implodes, then as a result, the entire Chinese bond market will collapse.

Many international banks, funds and institutions hold many Evergrande bonds, which are effectively worthless.

I feel that mainstream media is influencing individual traders to convince them that China is recovering. The Evergrande issue is being downplayed, and news is being silenced. The general narrative is that Chinese stock markets are making a comeback and are now safe to reinvest in. This message is especially effective since the Western markets are tumbling.

&#x200B;

[The S&P 500 is down 16&#37; since the start of the year.](https://preview.redd.it/fgsjg7ddc3z81.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=66463b8e096c2914752d7fe432bbcc654f9c397c)

&#x200B;

[The NASDAQ 100 is down 28&#37; since the start of the year.](https://preview.redd.it/will7pzfc3z81.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca47ecc237082064ca6ed4dae6f767397b1849e6)

The western market tanking is being blamed on the narrative that the Ukrainian War has caused inflation. The reality is that 80% of all USD that has ever been printed was done in the last two years.

The printed money was used to prop up the banks and institutions that were bleeding due to their foreign bonds becoming almost worthless pieces of paper, but still able to be used as leverage, as long as Evergrande doesn?檛 go bang!

Evergrande is no longer allowed to issue bonds, so they have flooded the market with Short Term Commercial Paper to help stay afloat, but they can?檛 just keep doing that.

Indicators show that Evergrande is getting increasingly unstable as no one has any faith in their revival. (Why would they?)

Because they are showing no signs of improvement, the margin requirements on the leverage of those bonds are increasing.

Particularly, Tether is increasingly stressed by these pressures and increasing margin requirements. The result is volatility.

[Look at the volatility of Tether, this chart compounds the Tether to it's global purchasing power. ](https://preview.redd.it/yuaym33jc3z81.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=5584c18801551b39e66cfaa6b2b90882b830b27d)

&#x200B;

[This is a coin designed to remain steady at a valuation of 1USD, at one point it depegged dramatically to $0.95 and had failed to get back on the peg \(Green Line\) ever since.](https://preview.redd.it/e24lq944saz81.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=921513c7fa39aa98962c197c7e6629e7bc945ec0)

小ryptocurrencies are bundled together and symbiotically linked due to the swaps and derivative markets.

Some of those institutions that algorithmically trade and swap the derivatives of the 小rypto market also use their ?淎I Algo??on Wallstreet. For the algo to function effectively, it needs to hedge on the opposite side of a bet, meaning most of these companies who use AI to trade for them have to ?渟hort sell??to win a little by backing both sides of the bet.

The AI found a hack. It realised if it could reduce a stock value to less than $0.01 (Cellarbox), it could dramatically gain substantial profits, and if it could also bankrupt it - they don?檛 need to pay taxes on the income.

The AI is connected via ?榮ignals??to many news outlets, who in turn create automated articles based on those signals to influence the market and the stock prices.

Many stocks, especially retail stores, were bundled together into a derivative and manipulated, but our beloved GAMESTOP broke the algorithm. The players beat the AI at its own game, and the mainstream media is trying to blame them for breaking the markets.

Quick recap: Evergrande is slowly bleeding; as a result, institutions are suffering, and margin requirements for them are increasing. This means they have increased margin requirements, and these requirements are creating stress on the financial markets, which is creating volatility.

With me so far?

As Evergrande and all the associated Chinese Commercial Paper continues to decline, then, as a result, the 小rypto markets will plummet with them. For example, If (when?) Evergrande goes boom; then Tether will not just dive 20%; it will go to ZERO!

Let me clarify: WHEN Evergrande files for bankruptcy, Tether will go bankrupt.

The majority of all 小ryptocurrencies will plummet due to the derivatives and swaps that the AI Algorithms are trading.

[Nearly all 小ryptocurrencies behave similar to BeeTeeCee, and are plummeting rapidly.](https://preview.redd.it/pzznxfcnc3z81.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=b071f50d9eebe208857d8bcbff3332589069a9e9)

NASDAQ, S&P500 and major financial indexes will continue to tumble.

Trading volume will tumble with it, as real people don?檛 like volatile times, and our flight or fright instincts kick in.

Flight people will be dumping all kinds and won't return until it is all over. Frightened people will just freeze and effectively hold through it all and do nothing - they will lose some of their equity because some of their holdings will go bankrupt.

A few will try and fight whoever remains in the arena, including the robots.

There will be less volume. Reduced volume means less liquidity. Less Liquidity means we may see halts very regularly.

It will get shitty. Some 小rypto exchanges will go bankrupt, taking people?檚 savings with them. Some unscrupulous executives/insiders of those exchanges will disappear like rats with whatever they can get their hands on.

Come on Gamestop! Get your non-custodial wallet, with minimal transaction fees, out of beta NOW - the world needs it, we need a safe haven for our LRC and IMX!

I think it?檚 important to understand the fight has begun, but it?檚 nowhere near over.

I would estimate we have seen about a 10-12% correction. The final correction size is anyone's guess, but my finger in the air guesses are between 20% (low) or perhaps as large as 70%. So we could be in round 1 of 2 or round 1 of 7.

The crash will destroy confidence. Especially when the idiots realise they created this themselves by letting the AI Algos loose on the markets.

Throughout this process, big institutions will get margin called. They?檒l be unable to make the margin requirements and will slowly be liquidated. For example, I estimate HSBC Bank holds about 60% of its stocks in Chinese Companies, which will shortly be practically worthless. BOOM!

Did you think Lehman Brothers going under was monumentally devastating?

Events like this will create a chain reaction that will look like the world's end. People will likely hurt themselves.

Ken Griffin what the fuck have you done? You are the textbook definition of a financial terrorist!

[Don?檛 dance, don?檛 say I told you so, be humble and do your best to help whoever you can.](https://preview.redd.it/0iuqqokvc3z81.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a09ea851f5cc182784b24b71861f7e5f30bfd24)

As these BIG institutions go under, then the value of ALL BONDS will be affected because The liquidations will destroy confidence in all banks and institutions. We?檒l see massive sell-offs of commercial bonds before this becomes mainstream global news.

Any company that has issued bonds will see interest payments rise steeply. That will cause similar problems to what we see with Evergrande. Those effects will reverberate around.

We could likely see defaults in companies who provide REAL things and services as their holdings (profits from over the years of operating) may be stored in those same bonds issued by companies and will be reduced to zero as the issuer goes bankrupt. Any loans on those financial assets could also be called in. An issue like this can cause actual cash flow and payment problems for the operating company.

This process will not take days, it will be drawn out over months and months. Here?檚 why; if a company wants to liquidate, they have to take financial advice first. That consultation process takes about 60-days. They then appoint a liquidator who instructs the people they owe money to that they?檙e ?済oing under?? and then the process cascades to their suppliers, etc.

There will be very little funding or loans available to help companies who are struggling, and they won't print more money because that?檚 what got us in this mess.

Please understand that this crash won't just affect the financial markets; jobs will be lost everywhere. Right now, not many people are even aware we are in a global crash, but it will get so dark that everyone (unless they live in a cave) will know. This is still only the first round.

Unemployment will rise, and ?渁rr/antiwork??will seem distant and beautiful sub to reminisce about.

Companies that survive will have to reign in dividends, cease stock buybacks and cut spending. The smart ones will keep a healthy cash balance and have organised loans for the shitstorm that?檚 about to hit. (Sound familiar?)

The whole market will collapse.

There is hope; Out of the ashes, a phoenix shall rise.

The next generation of trading and exchanges need to be transparent ??no fraudulent transactions ??no naked shorting ??no darkness ??lit everywhere.

All transactions will be recorded in an open ledger which is entirely transparent and readable by all.

No more automatons operating in the darkness, running wild, controlled by some Mickey mouse operation who arrogantly believe they are too big to fail.

A group of sorcerers have teamed-up up in the embodiment of Ryan Cohen and his newly formed team. I have faith he is strong enough to hold the weight of the clean-up task ahead.

&#x200B;

[You see it with your own eyes. You?檙e here right now, and you?檝e just been on a journey with me to the future.](https://preview.redd.it/64ely3r0d3z81.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=1549e84866b0e07e588f927c4cdd8588d7d4a612)

Try to keep this secret, but share it with your loved ones. Let?檚 keep them safe.

TLDR; Evergrande is going through a SLOW liquidation. Firstly, this allows banks to offload some of their bags. The slow decrease in value also means the margin requirements required to cover the decline in value of the stock increase slowly. They are causing Volatility. Many institutions holding these shitty bonds, trading 小rypto, operate short baskets, and that?檚 why there?檚 high volatility as the market goes through a slow crash. We are potentially 15-50% through the crash at this point. The full crash will ignite the world, and new systems will be built that will try to prevent a crash like this from ever happening again.

So far I've come across a lot of unsustainable ""ideas"" to make money with AI, but at the same time a few diamonds in the rough that aren't fully tapped into yet- especially the AAA model. Thought I'd share this post to shine light into this new business model and share some ways you could potentially start your own agency, or at the very least know who you are dealing with and how to pick and choose when you (inevitably) get bombarded with cold emails from them down the line.

# Foreword

Running an AAA does NOT involve using AI tools directly to generate and sell content directly. That ship has sailed, and unless you are happy with $5 from Fiverr every month or so, it is not a real business model. Cry me a river but generating generic art with AI and slapping it onto a T-shirt to sell on Etsy won't make you a dime.

At the same time, **the AAA model will NOT require you to have a deep theoretical knowledge of AI, or any academic degree**, as we are more so dealing with the practical applications of generative AI and how we can implement these into different workflows and tech-stacks, rather than building AI models from the ground up. Regardless of all that, common sense and a willingness to learn will help (a shit ton), as with anything.

Keep in mind - **this WILL involve work and motivation as well**. The mindset that AI somehow means everything can be done for you on autopilot is not the right way to approach things. The common theme of businesses I've seen who have successfully implemented AI into their operations is the willingess to work with AI in a way that augments their existing operations, rather than flat out replace a worker or team. And this is exactly the train of thought you need when working with AI as a business model.

However, as the field is relatively unsaturated and hype surrounding AI is still fresh for enterprises, right now is the prime time to start something new if generative AI interests you at all. With that being said, I'll be going over three of the most successful AI-adjacent businesses I've seen over this past year, in addition to some tips and resources to point you in the right direction.

# so.. WTF is an AI Automation Agency?

The AI automation agency (or as some YouTubers have coined it, the AAA model) at its core involves creating custom AI solutions for businesses. I have over 1500 AI tools listed in my directory, however the feedback I've received from some enterprise users is that ready-made SaaS tools are too generic to meet their specific needs. Combine this with the fact **virtually no smaller companies have the time or skills required to develop custom solutions** right off the bat, and you have yourself real demand. I would say in practice, the AAA model is quite similar to Wordpress and even web dev agencies, with the major difference being all solutions you develop will incorporate key aspects of AI AND automation.

Which brings me to my second point- JUST AI IS NOT ENOUGH. Rather than reducing the amount of time required to complete certain tasks, I've seen many AI agencies make the mistake of recommending and (trying to) sell solutions that more likely than not increase the workload of their clients. For example, if you were to make an internal tool that has AI answer questions based on their knowledge base, but this knowledge base has to be updated manually, this is creating unnecessary work. As such I think one of the key components of building successful AI solutions is incorporating the new (Generative AI/LLMs) with the old (programmtic automation- think Zapier, APIs, etc.).

Finally, for this business model to be successful, ideally you should **target a niche in which you have already worked and understand pain points and needs**. Not only does this make it much easier to get calls booked with prospects, the solutions you build will have much greater value to your clients (meaning you get paid more). A mistake I've seen many AAA operators make (and I blame this on the ""Get Rich Quick"" YouTubers) is focusing too much on a specific productized service, rather than really understanding the needs of businesses. The former is much done via a SaaS model, but when going the agency route the only thing that makes sense is building custom solutions. This is why **I always take a consultant-first approach**. You can only build once you understand what they actually need and how certain solutions may impact their operations, workflows, and bottom-line.

# Basics of How to Get Started

1. **Pick a niche.** As I mentioned previously, preferably one that you've worked in before. Niches I know of that are actively being bombarded with cold emails include real estate, e-commerce, auto-dealerships, lawyers, and medical offices. There is a reason for this, but I will tell you straight up this business model works well if you target any white-collar service business (internal tools approach) or high volume businesses (customer facing tools approach).
2. **Setup your toolbox.** If you wanted to start a pressure washing business, you would need a pressure-washer. This is no different. For those without programming knowledge, I've seen two common ways AAA get setup to build- one is having a network of on-call web developers, whether its personal contacts or simply going to Upwork or any talent sourcing agency. The second is having an arsenal of no-code tools. I'll get to this more in a second, but this works beecause at its core, when we are dealing with the practical applications of AI, the code is quite simple, simply put.
3. **Start cold sales.** Unless you have a network already, this is not a step you can skip. You've already picked a niche, so all you have to do is find the right message. Keep cold emails short, sweet, but enticing- and it will help a lot if you did step 1 correctly and intimately understand who your audience is. I'll be touching base later about how you can leverage AI yourself to help you with outreach and closing.

# The beauty of gen AI and the AAA model

You don't need to be a seasoned web developer to make this business model work. The large majority of solutions that SME clients want is best done using an API for an LLM for the actual AI aspect. **The value we create with the solutions we build comes with the conceptual framework and design that not only does what they need it to but integrates smoothly with their existing tech-stack and workflow.** The actual implementation is quite straightforward once you understand the high level design and know which tools you are going to use.

To give you a sense, even if you plan to build out these apps yourself (say in Python) the large majority of the nitty gritty technical work has already been done for you, especially if you leverage Python libraries and packages that offer high level abstraction for LLM-related functions. For instance, calling GPT can be as little as a single line of code. (And there are no-code tools where these functions are simply an icon on a GUI). Aside from understanding the capabilities and limitations of these tools and frameworks, the only thing that matters is being able to put them in a way that makes sense for what you want to build. Which is why outsourcing and no-code tools both work in our case.

# Okay... but how TF am I suppposed to actually build out these solutions?

Now the fun part. I highly recommend getting familiar with Langchain and LlamaIndex. Both are Python libraires that help a lot with the high-level LLM abstraction I mentioned previously. The two most important aspects include being able to integrate internal data sources/knowledge bases with LLMs, and have LLMs perform autonomous actions. The two most common methods respectively are RAG and output parsing.

**RAG (retrieval augmented Generation)**

If you've ever seen a tool that seemingly ""trains"" GPT on your own data, and wonder how it all works- well I have an answer from you. At a high level, the user query is first being fed to what's called a vector database to run vector search. Vector search basically lets you do semantic search where you are searching data based on meaning. The vector databases then retrieves the most relevant sections of text as it relates to the user query, and this text gets APPENDED to your GPT prompt to provide extra context to the AI. Further, with prompt engineering, you can limit GPT to only generate an answer if it can be found within this extra context, greatly limiting the chance of hallucination (this is where AI makes random shit up). Aside from vector databases, we can also implement RAG with other data sources and retrieval methods, for example SQL databses (via parsing the outputs of LLM's- more on this later).

**Autonomous Agents via Output Parsing**

A common need of clients has been having AI actually perform tasks, rather than simply spitting out text. For example, with autonomous agents, we can have an e-commerce chatbot do the work of a basic customer service rep (i.e. look into orders, refunds, shipping). At a high level, what's going on is that the response of the LLM is being used programmtically to determine which API to call. Keeping on with the e-commerce example, if I wanted a chatbot to check shipping status, I could have a LLM response within my app (not shown to the user) with a prompt that outputs a random hash or string, and programmatically I can determine which API call to make based on this hash/string. And using the same fundamental concept as with RAG, I can append the the API response to a final prompt that would spit out the answer for the user.

**How No Code Tools Can Fit In (With some example solutions you can build)**

With that being said, you don't necessarily need to do all of the above by coding yourself, with Python libraries or otherwise. **However, I will say that having that high level overview will help IMMENSELY when it comes to using no-code tools to do the actual work for you.** Regardless, here are a few common solutions you might build for clients as well as some no-code tools you can use to build them out.

* **Ex. Solution 1: AI Chatbots for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises)**
   * This involves creating **chatbots that handle user queries, lead gen, and so forth with AI**, and will use the principles of RAG at heart. After getting the required data from your client (i.e. product catalogues, previous support tickets, FAQ, internal documentation), you upload this into your knowledge base and write a prompt that makes sense for your use case. One no-code tool that does this well is **MyAskAI**. The beauty of it especially for building external chatbots is the ability to quickly ingest entire websites into your knowledge base via a sitemap, and bulk uploading files. Essentially, they've covered the entire grunt work required to do this manually. Finally, you can create a inline or chat widget on your client's website with a few lines of HTML, or altneratively integrate it with a Slack/Teams chatbot (if you are going for an internal Q&A chatbot approach). Other tools you could use include **Botpress and Voiceflow**, however these are less for RAG and more for building out complete chatbot flows that may or may not incorporate LLMs. Both apps are essentially GUIs that eliminate the pain and tears and trying to implement complex flows manually, and both natively incoporate AI intents and a knowledge base feature.
* **Ex. Solution 2: Internal Apps**
   * Similar to the first example, except we go beyond making just chatbots but tools such as report generation and really **any sort of internal tool or automations that may incorporate LLM's**. For instance, you can have a tool that automatically generates replies to inbound emails based on your client's knowledge base. Or an automation that does the same thing but for replies to Instagram comments. Another example could be a tool that generates a description and screeenshot based on a URL (useful for directory sites, made one for my own :P). Getting into more advanced implementations of LLMs, we can have tools that can generate entire drafts of reports (think 80+ pages), based not only on data from a knowledge base but also the writing style, format, and author voice of previous reports.
   * One good tool to create content generation panels for your clients would be **MindStudio**. You can train LLM's via prompt engineering in a structured way with your own data to essentially fine tune them for whatever text you need it to generate. Furthermore, it has a GUI where you can dictate the entire AI flow. You can also upload data sources via multiple formats, including PDF, CSV, and Docx.
   * For automations that require interactions between multiple apps, I recommend the OG **zapier/make.com** if you want a no-code solution. For instance, for the automatic email reply generator, I can have a trigger such that when an email is received, a custom AI reply is generated by **MyAskAI**, and finally a draft is created in my email client. Or, for an automation where I can create a social media posts on multiple platforms based on a RSS feed (news feed), I can implement this directly in Zapier with their native GPT action ([see screenshot](https://imgur.com/9rwpaz4))
   * As for more complex LLM flows that may require multiple layers of LLMs, data sources, and APIs working together to generate a single response i.e. a long form 100 page report, I would recommend tools such as Stack AI or Flowise (open-source alternative) to build these solutions out. Essentially, you get most of the functions and features of Python packages such as Langchain and LlamaIndex in a GUI. [See screenshot](https://imgur.com/o5trxuC) for an example of a flow

# How the hell are you supposed to find clients?

With all that being said, none of this matters if you can't find anyone to sell to. You will have to do cold sales, one way or the other, especially if you are brand new to the game. And what better way to sell your AI services than with AI itself? If we want to integrate AI into the cold outreach process, first we must identify what it's good at doing, and that's obviously writing a bunch of text, in a short amount of time. Similar to the solutions that an AAA can build for its clients, we can take advantage of the same principles in our own sales processes.

**How to do outreach**

Once you've identified your niche and their pain points/opportunities for automation, you want to craft a compelling message in which you can send via cold email and cold calls to get prospects booked on demos/consultations. I won't get into too much detail in terms of exactly how to write emails or calling scripts, as there are millions of resources to help with this, but I will tell you a few key points you want to keep in mind when doing outreach for your AAA.

First, you want to keep in mind that many businesses are still hesitant about AI and may not understand what it really is or how it can benefit their operations. However, we can take advantage of how mass media has been reporting on AI this past year- at the very least people are AWARE that sooner or later they may have to implement AI into their businesses to stay competitive. We want to frame our message in a way that introduces generative AI as a technology that can have a direct, tangible, and positive impact on their business. Although it may be hard to quantify, I like to include estimates of man-hours saved or costs saved at least in my final proposals to prospects. Times are TOUGH right now, and money is expensive, so you need to have a compelling reason for businesses to get on board.

Once you've gotten your messaging down, you will want to create a list of prospects to contact. Tools you can use to find prospects include **Apollo.io, reply.io, zoominfo (expensive af), and Linkedin Sales Navigator**. What specific job titles, etc. to target will depend on your niche but for smaller companies this will tend to be the owner. For white collar niches, i.e. law, the professional that will be directly benefiting from the tool (i.e. partners) may be better to contact. And for larger organizations you may want to target business improvement and digital transformation leads/directors- these are the people directly in charge of projects like what you may be proposing.

Okay- so you have your message, and your list, and now all it comes down to is getting the good word out. I won't be going into the details of how to send these out, a quick Google search will give you hundreds of resources for cold outreach methods. However, personalization is key and beyond simple dynamic variables you want to make sure you can either personalize your email campaigns directly with AI (SmartWriter.ai is an example of a tool that can do this), or at the very least have the ability to import email messages programmatically. Alternatively, ask ChatGPT to make you a Python Script that can take in a list of emails, scrape info based on their linkedin URL or website, and all pass this onto a GPT prompt that specifies your messaging to generate an email. From there, send away.

**How tf do I close?**

Once you've got some prospects booked in on your meetings, you will need to close deals with them to turn them into clients.

* Call #1: Consultation
   * Tying back to when I mentioned you want to take a consultant-first appraoch, you will want to listen closely to their goals and needs and understand their pain points. This would be the first call, and typically I would provide a high level overview of different solutions we could build to tacke these. It really helps to have a presentation available, so you can graphically demonstrate key points and key technologies. I like to use **Plus AI** for this, it's basically a Google Slides add-on that can generate slide decks for you. I copy and paste my default company messaging, add some key points for the presentation, and it comes out with pretty decent slides.
* Call #2: Demo
   * The second call would involve a demo of one of these solutions, and typically I'll quickly prototype it with boilerplate code I already have, otherwise I'll cook something up in a no-code tool. If you have a niche where one type of solution is commonly demanded, it helps to have a general demo set up to be able to handle a larger volume of calls, so you aren't burning yourself out. I'll also elaborate on how the final product would look like in comparison to the demo.
* Call #3 and Beyond:
   * Once the initial consultation and demo is complete, you will want to alleviate any remaining concerns from your prospects and work with them to reach a final work proposal. It's crucial you lay out exactly what you will be building (in writing) and ensure the prospect understands this. Furthermore, be clear and transparent with timelines and communication methods for the project. In terms of pricing, you want to take this from a value-based approach. The same solution may be worth a lot more to client A than client B. Furthermore, you can create ""add-ons"" such as monthly maintenance/upgrade packages, training sessions for employeees, and so forth, separate from the initial setup fee you would charge.

**How you can incorporate AI into marketing your businesses**

Beyond cold sales, I highly recommend creating a funnel to capture warm leads. For instance, I do this currently with my AI tools directory, which links directly to my AI agency and has consistent branding throughout. Warm leads are much more likely to close (and honestly, much nicer to deal with).

However, even without an AI-related website, at the very least you will want to create a presence on social media and the web in general. As with any agency, you will want basic a professional presence. A professional virtual address helps, in addition to a Google Business Profile (GBP) and TrustPilot. a GBP (especially for local SEO) and Trustpilot page also helps improve the looks of your search results immensely.

For GBP, I recommend using **ProfilePro**, which is a chrome extension you can use to automate SEO work for your GBP. Aside from SEO optimzied business descriptions based on your business, it can handle Q/A answers, responses, updates, and service descriptions based on local keywords.

**Privacy and Legal Concerns of the AAA Model**

Aside from typical concerns for agencies relating to service contracts, there are a few issues (especially when using no-code tools) that will need to be addressed to run a successful AAA. Most of these surround privacy concerns when working with proprietary data. In your terms with your client, you will want to clearly define hosting providers and any third party tools you will be using to build their solution, and a DPA with these third parties listed as subprocessors if necessary. In addition, you will want to implement best practices like redacting private information from data being used for building solutions. In terms of addressing concerns directly from clients, it helps if you host your solutions on their own servers (not possible with AI tools), and address the fact only ChatGPT queries in the web app, not OpenAI API calls, will be used to train OpenAI's models (as reported by mainstream media). The key here is to be open and transparent with your clients about ALL the tools you are using, where there data will be going, and make sure to get this all in writing.

# have fun, and keep an open mind

Before I finish this post, I just want to reiterate the fact that this is NOT an easy way to make money. Running an AI agency will require hours and hours of dedication and work, and constantly rearranging your schedule to meet prospect and client needs. However, if you are looking for a new business to run, and have a knack for understanding business operations and are **genuinely interested in the pracitcal applications of generative AI**, then I say go for it. The time is ticking before AAA becomes the new dropshipping or SMMA, and I've a firm believer that those who set foot first and establish themselves in this field will come out top. And remember, while 100 thousand people may read this post, only 2 may actually take initiative and start.",1413,223,1696952214,
Civil Engineering is a great (and underrated) way to get into the middle class,"**Civil Engineering** is an underrated career that I almost never see mentioned in this sub. It?檚 almost guaranteed to get you into the middle class within the first few years of your career, and upper-middle class within a decade or two.

Schooling wise, you can get by with a 4 year degree in nearly all cases. Sure, a masters helps, but is definitely not a requirement. Prestige of institution doesn?檛 matter - just go to your cheapest state school and get your CE degree. Because you can get away with cheap degree, you don?檛 need 6 figure debt to enter the fields. And as long as you are reasonably competent and determine, you shouldn?檛 have any difficulty getting through the coursework.

Professional licensure is the most important step in developing your career. If you are a professional engineer (PE) with 10+ years of quality experience, you?檒l have to fend recruiters off with a stick.

The infrastructure gap in the US has been widening since the Great Recession, and now we are paying the price for a decade-plus of underinvestment in roads, bridges, buildings, housing, sewers, dams, water treatment, etc. 

And the lack of quality professionals right now is extremely noticeable - the Boomer engineers & have largely retired, or will be in the next decade. Many of the GenX?檈rs left during the Great Recession due to the pull back in the housing market & construction spending, and never came back. Millennials went into tech en masse rather than CE, and now tech is way oversaturated. 

A ton of institutional knowledge is on the way out, and good professionals are needed to fill the gap. Pretty much every discipline of civil engineering (water resources, structural, geotechnical, construction, & transportation) are hiring right now.

These are solid, steady jobs that will put you in the upper middle class and are pretty much impossible to outsource. Automation & AI is nowhere close to being able to take over (despite what the latest tech grifter says). Is it forever AI proof? No - but by the time AI can do this job, it will have taken over a bunch of other jobs first.",492,293,1723311402,

"Tired of seeing ""just try harder"" every time someone voice their worries about the job market.","Before I rant, I'd like to ask do you think there would be so much panic and fearmongering in the tech indsutry if we all have a social safety net, a universal basic income of some sort? Would YOU be living in fear then?

Every time someone voice their worries about AI taking jobs, the response is always the same: ""Just improve your skills. Adapt. Outcompete others.""

But let?檚 be honest, this isn?檛 about progress. It?檚 about keeping us trapped in an endless cycle of fear and competition. 

We?檝e been conditioned to believe that if we just work harder, we?檒l be safe. The idea of blindly sacrificing your life just for a chance of having a job is literally slavery. It's just that no one recognizes that, because STEM bros are always shitting on humanities subjects - subjects that taught us to see beyond what's in front of our eyes, to see the economy, to see the politics, to see that modern slavery social engineered us to pit against each others to survive.

I know someone will come here and say ""but what about supply and demand"". The market isn?檛 ""free"" when a handful of billionaires own the AI, the data, and the infrastructure that decide the fate of millions. They lay off workers, automate jobs, and amass unimaginable wealth, while the rest of us are told to ""hustle harder"" or be left behind.

The issue isn?檛 AI, it?檚 the system that prioritizes profit over people. And until we address that, no amount of ""stop doomposting and just try harder"" will solve anything.",319,147,1740647777,
"How To Start An AI Agency - Get Off The Grift Train And Stop Watching Youtubers Who Allegedly Earn 70,000 A Month","Alright so who the hell am I to dish out advice on this?  Well I am no one really, but I am an AI Engineer and, amongst other things, I run my own AI Agency, im not posting links unless you ask in the comments, because I am doing my best not to be spammy.  Im not posting this here looking for work or attention, im doing this because the Youtuber grift is REAL, consuming tens of videos a day on how you can make $70,000 a month is BS right now.

In this post im going tell you what ITS REALLY LIKE starting an AI agency from scratch with NO MONEY.  And I am going to tell you how you really go about making money and getting customers. 

THIS IS A GRIFT

There are a handful of youtubers in this fledgling AI Agents industry of ours that bang on constantly about how much money you can make, their long videos with whiteboards and even their own acronyms and all they do is funnel you in to their training academy's where you pay basically for more of of this content.   This is damaging because at first site you watch some of these videos, you may have built some basic agents and your brain is going ""Holly shit I can earn $25,000 a week sitting at my desk!??!!?!"".  Its BS.  They are making the vast majority of their money teaching you how to run an automation agency rather than teaching you how to be an AI engineer who can turn those skills in to $$$.

OK, SO HOW DO YOU START?

Alright well first of all you don't really need anything other than a laptop and a small amount of money for API costs.  You dont need a website or even a business name to start.  What you need to do first is validate that you can actually do this. 

STEP 1

Learn about AI agents, how they work, how to build them etc.  Build some projects for yourself or your mum.

STEP 2

Once you have built some agents or automations start telling everyone, in fact tell anyone who will listen, offer to the build personal assistants (GPTs) for people, basic agents, basic automations and get some feedback.

STEP 3

Approach some friends or friends of friends who have a business and offer to build some agents and automations for free and use their API keys - so its not costing you anything other than time. 

At this point leverage templates where you can to save time. 

Really try to solve a genuine business problem and do it for free in return for a favourable written testimonial from the business. 

THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I STARTED!  

IF you can find a niche that you understand then even better.  For me I have a distant real estate background. I know a family member who currently works in real estate so I offered to automate some of her work for free, I also built her a series of GPT assistants for various things.  SHE LOVED IT and told everyone about it.  From there I got a few more people in her company and another company and then once I had built a few automations and agents for several real estate people I had some testimonials.

What I had done is VALIDATED my idea, Ive proved I can do it (I knew that bit anyway because I am already an AI Engineer) and now I have some testimonials from real customers.

  
STEP 4

Start making $70,000 a month!!!   Not yeh hold on... Now you gotta put the hard work in... Yeh because guess what?  Like running any other small business this is F'ing hard work.  Don't expect to put your OPEN sign up and be flooded with customers desperate to give you cash.  It isn't like that. 

Step 4 is get yourself a business name and a website.  Don't over think so step.  Just a basic well presented site, use a template to speed things up and get it online. This should take you know more than a week to choose a name and get a website up and running.  Make sure that those testimonials are prominent on the site and maybe add a blog section where you can post all your projects. 

Step 5

Ok now you are legit.  Sit back and just bank that cash baby!  Yeh ok im still joking.  You gotta a lot of work to do now. Start by contacting other companies in the area in the same industry sector who could benefit from your previous work.  For me this was other real estate companies. Start with smaller companies because the decision to use AI can be made quickly.  Work you way through them and make sure you use testimonials in any out reach.  

For example:

""I built this AI agent for X and Co, it saved them 500 hours per year - I can do the same for you""

Do not over think this stage, keep the marketing to the point.

Step 6  
Grow to $70,000 per month!   This final step is just about growing. From this point you hopefully will have some paying customers and some great testimonials and you can start advertising.  But seriously put the 70k a month thing out of your head - you MIGHT get to that point, and I hope you will.  But stay realistic and you gotta work hard. 

This new world of AI and agents might blow our minds - but the fact is MOST people are still quite sceptical about AI.  Even if you can save X and Co $50,000 a year by automating their emails, they still might say no because they are worried about AI taking everyones jobs in a month! 

Start small, take your time, work hard and MAYBE one day you can be just like those grifters on Youtube and tell everyone who will listen that you make $70,000 a month sat in your pajamas with a laptop.

Good luck to you all.",302,153,1740808381,
Non-Engineering women in tech - let's learn AI together!,"Hey folks, as someone who works in tech but is not an engineer, I personally felt overwhelmed for a while as 2023-2024's AI rush came on. It seemed me everyone was talking about LLMs, agents, and what new job AI can automate tomorrow. As someone who wants to keep working, I know I have to learn and get ahead of AI before it gets ahead of me and my career.

I spoke to some of my friends in the industry and some feel similarly, particularly those in Sales / Marketing / GTM / Operations / PM roles. Many women who are returning from caregiving also are now trying to level up in AI knowledge and want to connect with others doing the same.

Which brings me to my soapbox :P - I've now formed a community of folks in VC/PE, Marketing / Sales / Operations in Tech, Policy, finance, and non-CS academia who are looking to learn together in a biweekly/monthly setting together. I hope to make knowledge accessible for all in smaller group sessions, help folks stay ahead of AI, and have a sense of community and connection in the honestly scary labor market we're currently in.

If you're interested, feel free to ping me to join! This is a basic learning group where we will not be learning advanced AI/ML, but covering what is AI, how to leverage it in daily work, who the major players are, and how to set up a learning process so you can always keep abreast of the new developments.

Full disclosure: I'm still working on the curriculum (it's a lot of information to get through), so I'd say we can do the first session \~Mid March

In manufacturing, AI and ML will drive further automation of production lines and enable predictive maintenance. AI systems can optimize production schedules, reduce waste, and predict equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime. While these advancements will increase efficiency and lower costs, they may also lead to job displacement for workers in repetitive, manual roles. However, new jobs will emerge in areas such as AI system management, maintenance, and data analysis, requiring workers to acquire new technical skills.

**3. Finance: Transforming Risk Management and Customer Service**

The financial industry will see significant changes due to AI and ML, particularly in risk management, fraud detection, and customer service. AI can analyze large datasets to identify patterns and anomalies, helping financial institutions detect fraudulent activities and assess credit risks more accurately. In customer service, AI chatbots and virtual assistants will handle routine inquiries, freeing up human agents for more complex tasks. This shift will demand new skills in AI oversight and customer interaction, while potentially reducing the number of traditional customer service roles.

**4. Retail: Personalizing Shopping Experiences and Optimizing Supply Chains**

In retail, AI and ML will enhance personalization and supply chain management. AI-driven recommendation engines will provide customers with tailored product suggestions based on their browsing and purchase history, improving the overall shopping experience. On the supply chain side, AI can predict demand, optimize inventory levels, and streamline logistics, reducing costs and improving delivery times. Retail workers will need to adapt to these changes, with a growing emphasis on data analysis and digital marketing skills.

**5. Transportation: Advancing Autonomous Vehicles and Smart Traffic Management**

The transportation industry will undergo a profound transformation with the rise of autonomous vehicles and AI-driven traffic management systems. Self-driving cars and trucks will become more common, potentially reducing the need for human drivers. Meanwhile, AI will optimize traffic flow in cities, reducing congestion and improving fuel efficiency. While these advancements will enhance safety and efficiency, they may also lead to job losses in driving-related occupations. However, there will be new opportunities in vehicle maintenance, software development, and transportation planning.

**6. Education: Personalizing Learning and Enhancing Administrative Efficiency**

AI and ML will play a significant role in personalizing education and improving administrative efficiency. AI-driven learning platforms can adapt to individual students??needs, providing customized learning experiences and improving educational outcomes. Additionally, AI can automate administrative tasks such as grading and scheduling, allowing educators to focus more on teaching. The integration of AI in education will require teachers to develop new skills in using technology to enhance learning, while also raising ethical concerns about data privacy and the potential for algorithmic bias.



The impact of AI and ML on industries and jobs over the next decade will be profound, offering both opportunities and challenges.

&#x200B;

Hi all!

I'm happy to announce that the 3.4.3 hotfix should now be live and available on all platforms!

[On Monday I said](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/the-next-steps-as-overlords.1525810/) that we were planning to address primary issues as quickly as we could and have a larger patch in a few weeks, but the team was ***absolutely on fire*** and was able to bring many of the fixes and changes that were originally scheduled for the later release into this hotfix. As a result, the 3.4.3 hotfix is significantly larger than a hotfix would usually be.

I want to stress exactly how helpful the bug reports we received were during this process - they made it possible for QA to generate a list of the biggest issues affecting the community and helped us prioritize our work, so thank you for submitting them, and please continue doing so if you run into issues.

Without further ado, here are...

Stellaris 3.4.3 ?楥epheus??Patch Notes

\#################################################################

\######################### VERSION 3.4.3 ############################

\#################################################################

Revolt and Planet Stability related fixes and changes:

* When planets revolt, there is now an option to declare war on the new country immediately rather than being subjected to a 10-year truce. The revolting planet counts as the aggressor. (if the planet joins another empire, and you choose war with them, the other country is now considered the aggressor).
* Revolt Situations no longer cause escalating stability maluses, as these could make it impossible to stop a revolt. They now give a flat 10 stability malus at all stages.
* The modifier a pop gets from its faction's happiness now updates properly (so if you make a faction happier, it will correctly make its pops happier now).
* Fixed it being possible for a Revolt Situation to start and immediately cancel. (They will now only start if the planet is calculated to be currently capable of succeeding the revolt)
* Planets with Culture Shock can now only start a revolt situation after 8 years of unrest, rather than 1, as it could be quite hard to avoid a revolt on these planets. Otherwise newly-conquered planets have 4-year cooldowns.
* Improved AI decision making on Revolt Situations.
* Fixed cases where rebels and released empires would have traditions and techs they should not have had access to (e.g. if non-gestalt pops rebelled against a gestalt empire).
* Fixed cases where rebels and released empires would use their parent countries scientists for research. I.e. the researcher would be active in both countries, until one country changed their task.
* Cleaned up some unclear language in the tooltip for Revolt Situation progress (the one describing what you can do about it).
* Void Dwellers now replace the 1 Politician (or Executive) job from Habitat Administration buildings with two Colonist jobs, which should increase their overall stability in the early game.
* Doomsday origin starting planets will no longer clamor to revolt. (Revolt Situations are disabled on them.)

Deficit related fixes and changes:

* To help them to deal with unexpected deficits, Empires can now purchase basic or advanced resources (specifically food or consumer goods) from the internal market if they have expenses of that type, even if they do not produce any themselves.
* Fixed never-ending deficits - if you go into a deficit of a resource you do not produce at all, and then stop spending it (i.e. end up with both expenses and income of 0), the deficit will now resolve itself in a few months. This solves issues with machines having inexplicable food and consumer goods deficits, as well as cases where people over-spend rare resources they gained via event.
* All resources provided for deficit bailouts now scale with the game year, instead of just those for the situation that completed.
* Fixed a case where the situation approach to cut the maintenance of habitats would count double.
* Fixed stray reference to Minerals in the Consumer Goods Deficit Situation.

Subject and Agreement related fixes and changes:

* Subjects should no longer flip-flop between regular subject types and protectorate.
* Fix issue where a new subject created from a Status Quo would be made up of the wrong systems.
* Subjects can no longer sign Defensive Pacts or Guarantee Independence of other empires.
* Releasing a sector as a subject or enlightening a pre-ftl civilization now ignores the cooldown on agreement negotiation.
* Increased the effects of Relative Power on AI acceptance of agreement negotiation.
* Added base acceptance for subsidiary.
* Tweaked AI acceptance of resource contribution terms, making them more likely to accept harsher tithes/subsidies.
* AI overlords and subjects will now be more likely to accept specialist subject types that disagree with their ethics.
* Set minimum Advanced Resources tax for Prospectorium to 15% from 30%
* Fixed ACTION\_DEMAND\_SUBJUGATION\_NOTIFICATION and ACTION\_ASK\_TO\_BECOME\_SUBJUGATED\_NOTIFICATION loc keys.
* Fix for trade deals that are accepted and then canceled immediately.
* Fixed AI not taking relative power into account when considering subjugation proposals.
* You can no longer set the priority of overlord catalytic or metallurgist jobs.
* Overlord catalytic jobs no longer have the pre-3.4 penalties for food deficits.
* Corporate overlords now have access to the protectorate subject type.
* Slaves can now be ""employed"" as mind-thralls.
* Fixed issue when removing/replacing overlord removes the corporate holdings.
* The Divided Patronage loyalty penalty is now correctly removed from existing subjects when taking Shared Destiny, Feudal Society or Franchising.
* You can no longer immediately see the secret fealty status of sectors released as subjects.
* Rebalanced trade weights for specialist subject leaders.
* Subjects that are converting to a specialist subject can continue conversion even if they should flip to a protectorate.
* Subjects that are converting to a specialist subject cannot flip to a protectorate due to low tech level.
* Empires can no longer have negative diplomatic weight.

Game Stability related fixes and changes:

* Fixed crash connected with resettling the last pop of a species.
* Fixed a rare crash in the Situations interface.
* Fixed crash with modded shipsets.
* Fixed a crash that would happen when generating very large galaxies with high hyperlane density.
* Fixed a crash related to Federation Laws.

Ship related fixes and changes:

* Ship starting experience modifiers now work when provided empire-wide (e.g. Fleet Supremacy edict)
* Fixed tracking not countering evasion.
* Added missing ship components for Offspring ships.
* Mercenary fleets are now buffed by Offspring Auras
* Added missing L2 Battleship section for Offspring Battleships.
* Fixed ship build and upgrade cost modifiers not being applied correctly when retrofitting ships.
* Fixed certain AIs (the ones with Calamitous Birth and Private Colony Ships) never colonizing.
* You can no longer found mercenary enclaves using fleets belonging to your federation or the galactic community.

Other fixes and changes:

* Legacy Human portraits have been re-added as an option in empire creation.
* Fixed pops that grow as specialists on Colonies.
* Fixed pops which go into a loop of swapping jobs with unemployed specialists constantly resetting strata demotion timers.
* Amenity job management is now activated even when there are no resources available for planet automation.
* Fixed an issue where planet automation could not use resources from their local sector stockpile.
* Planet automation will now check that the unemployed pops can work the jobs that the automation would build, e.g. preventing specialist job creation for slave pops.
* Reduced the amount of research given by merc dividends.
* Fixed an issue where systems with primitives in them would not be transferred correctly during a status quo war resolution.
* Non-Prophet Organization now correctly checks for the Teachers of the Shroud origin.
* Fixed the Stellar Performance achievement not being awarded properly.
* Subterranean empire are now shown uncapped mining districts on uncolonised worlds.
* The Crystalline Bane modifier is now removed if you kill the Crystal Kraken in a dishonorable manner.
* Progenitor Nest deposit is no longer removed when terraforming a planet into a hive-world.
* Hive worlds now provide an offspring drone for progenitor hives instead of a spawning drones.
* Fixed the Cyro Pod warrior event for xenophobes.
* Meeting the artist enclave now sets the correct flag.
* Added tooltip on create office branch button when players could not open a branch office.
* Shroudwalker greeting event now fires only once.
* Fixed tooltip for starbase resource silos.

\###################

New Known Issues

\###################

* Localization for non-English languages related to these changes will be coming in a future update.
* When negotiating an agreement, if the other party does not wish to accept the terms but does not have the influence necessary to decline, the eventual notification says that the deal timed out and auto-declined when in fact it was auto-accepted.

**So what's next?**

We'll be continuing to keep an eye on things, so keep those bug reports and feedback flowing. Currently our plan is to have a 3.4.4 update in a few weeks, that will contain localization updates for the 3.4.3 hotfix, more fixes and balance adjustments.

A sneak peek of some of the things we're looking at for the planned patch include the following:

Stellaris 3.4.4 Partial Sneak Peek

* The Imperial Fiefdom will start with colonies close to every member of their empire, so nobody will feel left out of the fold. Those who feel particularly loyal will now also be able to remain a vassal of the empire after the civil war has started.
* Added Hydroponics Station designation for habitats. This designation removes 2 housing from Habitation Districts in exchange for adding 1 farmer jobs.
* Ships now gain 5 exp per day in battle instead of 1.
* Doubled the base unity output of telepaths.
* Khan should no longer be hostile to mercenaries.
* Admirals no longer abandon their post on leased fleets.
* Planetary automation will no longer seek to build gene clinics if you are a synthetically-ascended empire.
* Planetary automation will now seek to clear blockers as soon as there is any need. It now uses the same formula as the indicator on the outliner: i.e. if it is limiting the number of districts OR if there are buildings that could be built by clearing the blockers OR if planet growth speed is reduced (previous behaviour was to only check the first of those).
* Fixed issue where planetary automation would upgrade Necrophage Centers of Elevation (which is often undesirable as it may lead to you running out of necrophytes)
* Newly colonized planets will now have their planet automation turned on if they are in an automated sector
* Made some clarifications for the Shroudwalkers, so it is clearer what asset you are getting from them and how the planet modifier works.
* You can no longer build an orbital ring around a planet with a destroyed orbital ring.
* Added is\_human\_species scripted trigger if you want additional portraits to be considered humans.
* Added on\_fleet\_lease\_started/ended on\_actions for more friendly mod compatibility
* Added is\_human\_species scripted trigger if you want additional portraits to be considered humans.

We also have some quality of life automation improvements planned for 3.4.4:

* Automated Exploration and Automated Research are now available from the start of the game rather than being tech-locked.
* Construction ships now have an Automated Construction mode, which will automatically build Research and Mining Stations over appropriate deposits. (It will not automatically build Observation Stations, Hyper Relays, or other constructions.)

"I?檓 Justin Maxwell. I co-founded an AI-receptionist company, and have designed for Apple, Google, Mint/Intuit, and...Theranos. AMA!","Edit/Clarification since ""AI-receptionist"" is throwing things off a bit: 

Our team is **real, U.S.-based receptionists, answering the phones and chats**. We built an AI-powered system assisting them in doing an amazing job. So yes, we can all agree that automated phone trees are frustrating. Thankfully that's not what this is about.

- We're not a bot IVR system (""Press 1 for an awful experience, 2 to get frustrated"").
- We're not replacing humans with robots
- We are not ushering the downfall of humanity (but I've enjoyed that discussion, so thanks)

Hello Reddit! My name is Justin Maxwell. I've designed websites, apps, products & led design teams for Apple, Google & Android, Mint.com/Intuit, Sony, and some very bad ideas startups along the way, ranging from those that fizzled out to those that turned into books & movies...like Theranos. (Oh, I even got to make the vector art for Jhonen Vasquez's Invader Zim logo along the way.)

Eventually I realized I'm a terrible employee, I hate writing weekly status reports for managers, and I like building things directly for customers I can speak with. So, in 2015, I started [Smith.ai](https://smith.ai) with Aaron Lee (ex-CTO of The Home Depot) ??we're customer qualification for small businesses, with humans assisted by AI. We're popular with Attorneys, I.T. Consultants, Marketers, and a long tail of everyone from home remediation to agricultural lighting systems providers.

In the past 3 years we've been growing in the high double digits, answered hundreds of thousands of calls, our customers love us, and we're able to even give back to the charities & communities our team cares about. What sets us apart is our combination of humans + AI and extreme focus on customer need. So, ask me anything!

# It Begins

As the calendar flipped to 2024, the gaming landscape trembled. Not from the excitement of groundbreaking releases or technological marvels, but from the seismic shifts of layoffs and restructuring. In 2023 alone, an estimated 10,500 souls in the industry found themselves cast adrift. This year, the numbers swelled to a staggering 11,000 and counting.

The culprit? A perfect storm of post-pandemic market corrections, corporate consolidation, and the looming specter of artificial intelligence.

# Whispers in the Machine

[They will replace everyone if they can...](https://preview.redd.it/u92bjaoh13hd1.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1c3cf7aa9f6a81717882ff8ccd8485ae5cbf1ad)

Noah, an artist at Activision (name changed to protect the vulnerable), recalls the moment dread settled into his bones. It was a seemingly innocuous email from the company's CTO, Michael Vance, speaking of AI's ""promise"" for the future of game development. But where executives saw opportunity, Noah and his colleagues saw shadows creeping across their careers.

""I felt that we were throwing away our humanity,"" Noah confessed, his voice heavy with the weight of an uncertain future.

These weren't isolated incidents. Across the industry, from AAA behemoths to scrappy indie outfits, similar scenes played out. Managers spoke of ""efficiency"" and ""cutting-edge tools,"" while artists exchanged worried glances and whispered fears in backchannel chats.

# The Invisible Hand of Progress

The march of AI into gaming isn't a dramatic invasion, but a subtle infiltration. It begins with ""concept art"" generated in seconds, character designs birthed from prompts rather than painstaking sketches. Tasks once requiring days of human creativity are condensed into mere moments of machine processing.

""Why get a bunch of expensive concept artists or designers when you can get an art director to give some bad directions to an AI and get stuff that's good enough, really fast?攁nd get a few artists to clean it up?"" laments Violet, a veteran developer with over a decade in the trenches of AAA game production.

This insidious creep of automation doesn't always manifest as outright job losses. Instead, it's the gradual erosion of roles, the deskilling of once-prized talents. Artists find themselves relegated to ""AI trainers"" or ""clean-up"" crews, their creative spark dimmed to a flicker.

# The Numbers Game

The cold, hard statistics paint a grim picture. A survey by CVL Economics found that nearly 90 percent of video game companies had already implemented generative AI programs. More chilling still, estimates suggest AI may contribute to more than half of the game development process within the next decade.

For an industry already grappling with precarious employment, rampant crunch culture, and a workforce largely bereft of union protections, this looming AI revolution feels less like progress and more like a guillotine poised above their necks.

# Voices in the Wilderness

Not all hope is lost. Pockets of resistance flicker in the digital darkness. Some studios have taken principled stands against the indiscriminate use of AI, recognizing the value of human creativity in crafting truly memorable gaming experiences.

But for every company drawing a line in the sand, there are others charging headlong into the AI frontier. Electronic Arts' CEO Andrew Willson speaks of ""workforce opportunities"" even as layoffs mount. Tencent pushes for AI integration while Riot Games, its subsidiary, sheds hundreds of jobs.

The dissonance between corporate messaging and on-the-ground reality is deafening.

# The Human Cost

Behind every statistic, every corporate memo, lies a human story. There's Rachael Cross, a concept artist laid off from Riot Games mere weeks after assurances that AI wouldn't replace their work. There's the anonymous Activision employee watching helplessly as their department is gutted, the survivors forced to embrace the very tools that may have cost their colleagues their livelihoods.

These aren't just job losses; they're dreams deferred, careers derailed, and creative voices silenced.

# A Race to the Bottom

[All Gas No Brakes](https://preview.redd.it/mzlrcrz023hd1.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b98639389d30bca7b87fd4a9d0a2d46fe5e81c6)

The insidious nature of this AI revolution extends beyond the walls of major studios. It seeps into the very fabric of the industry, creating a race to the bottom in terms of labor costs and creative value.

Outsourcing, long a contentious practice in gaming, takes on a new dimension when coupled with AI. Work that once supported countless artists in countries like China now faces decimation. Leo Li, a gaming industry recruiter in Hangzhou, reports a staggering 70 percent drop in illustrator jobs, driven in part by the proliferation of AI tools.

Even more alarming are startups like Crypko AI, offering AI-generated character illustrations at a fraction of the cost of human artists. When a month's worth of machine-generated art costs less than a single human-crafted piece, how can flesh-and-blood creators hope to compete?

# The Uncertain Horizon

As the industry hurtles towards an AI-augmented future, questions linger. Will the pursuit of efficiency and cost-cutting truly lead to better games? Or will it result in a homogenized landscape of ""good enough"" products, bereft of the spark that only human creativity can provide?

More pressingly, what becomes of the armies of artists, writers, and designers who have poured their lives into this industry? Will they be forced to adapt, to become mere custodians of the machines that have usurped their roles? Or will they find themselves cast aside, their skills deemed obsolete in this brave new world?

# A Call to Arms

[Fight back to bring the soul back to gaming!](https://preview.redd.it/md3zrx0523hd1.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d573d33094eaa66000be8763342fa79298e748e)

The battle for the soul of gaming is far from over. As AI tools proliferate, so too does awareness of their potential impact. Calls for unionization grow louder, with 57 percent of developers surveyed by GDC organizers expressing support for collective action.

The lessons learned from other creative industries, like the protections secured by Hollywood writers against unchecked AI use, offer a glimmer of hope. But time is of the essence.

# The Choice Before Us

As players, creators, and custodians of this vibrant medium, we stand at a crossroads. The path we choose now will determine whether the future of gaming is one of soulless efficiency or continued human artistry.

Will we allow the relentless march of progress to trample the very people who have given us countless hours of joy and wonder? Or will we demand a future where technology augments human creativity rather than replace it?

The power lies in our hands, in the games we choose to support, and the voices we amplify. The final level of this particular game has yet to be written. The question is: who will be left to write it?",6,0,1722967481,

#I. Introduction

##Definition of Dropshipping
A method of retail sales where the store does not maintain a physical inventory of products in stock but instead purchases the item from a third-party (typically the manufacturer or wholesaler) every time they make a sale and have the third-party ship it directly to the end consumer.

##The First Sale Doctrine and Dropshipping
The First Sale Doctrine is a USA legal principle that allows the buyers of a product to resell that product no matter what the copyright holder desires. This is incredibly important for dropshippers to understand.

From the Justice.gov website: ""The first sale doctrine, codified at 17 U.S.C. 搂 109, provides that an individual who knowingly purchases a copy of a copyrighted work from the copyright holder receives the right to sell, display or otherwise dispose of that particular copy, notwithstanding the interests of the copyright owner. The right to distribute ends, however, once the owner has sold that particular copy. See 17 U.S.C. 搂 109(a) & (c). Since the first sale doctrine never protects a defendant who makes unauthorized reproductions of a copyrighted work, the first sale doctrine cannot be a successful defense in cases that allege infringing reproduction."" 

read more here: https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1854-copyright-infringement-first-sale-doctrine

In essence the First Sale Doctrine allows the owner of a legally-purchased copy of a copyrighted item to sell or transfer that particular copy without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. This means that once a person lawfully purchases a copyrighted product, they have the right to resell it without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. You've seen this at resale shops, garage sales, online auctions, etc...

In the context of dropshipping, the First Sale Doctrine can be relevant because it allows dropshippers to sell products that they have legally acquired from a supplier without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. As long as the dropshipper has legally purchased the products and the products are genuine, they can be resold without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.

However, it's important to note that the First Sale Doctrine has its limitations. For example, it doesn't protect dropshippers who sell counterfeit or pirated products. If a dropshipper sells counterfeit or pirated products, they could still face legal action from the copyright owner. Copyright owners might also try and limit the usage of their copyrighted works from unauthorized dropshippers including photography, video, marketing materials, and other copyrighted works related to the product being sold.

In addition, some copyright owners may try to limit the application of the First Sale Doctrine by imposing restrictions on the resale of their products. For example, some software manufacturers include license agreements that prohibit the resale of their products. In these cases, dropshippers would need to comply with the terms of the license agreement or risk infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights.

When starting your dropshipping venture the First Sale Doctrine can be an important legal principle for you to understand and navigate, as it can impact your ability to sell certain products without infringing on the copyright owner's exclusive rights. 

**Example in the Wild:**  
There's an example out of Texas where an entrepreneur started selling products from the gas station Buc-ee's who does not have their own online store. Buc-ee's can't stop the resale, but they were able to request that the seller change the name of the store so that it did not confuse consumers that the store might be official. That entrepreneur visits their local Buc-ee's once per week, takes photos, selects new products to sell, and charges a fee to buyers for their efforts. *(note: This isn't exactly dropshipping since the merchant buys the product at retail then ships it themselves. It is merely an example of the First Sale Doctrine being applied currently)*

##Types of Dropshipping  
There are a lot of different configurations that all fall under the umbrella of 'dropshipping'. Here we are just trying to give you some basic descriptions of some of the main ones:  

* **Classic Dropshipping** - Simple enough, you sell a product at markup and order it from the manufacturer/wholesaler and they ship it to your customer for you. Most often this is done via ecommerce and is designed so the company has almost zero overhead outside of marketing materials.   
* **Print on Demand Dropshipping** - In this configuration a garment / object printing company uses expensive direct to product printing machines to print orders but also keeps the garments / objects in stock, ships them out on your behalf, and may also offer automation to keep your website / storefront updated.  *Note: this might also include a 3d-printing company or waterjet company*
* **Private-Label Dropshipping** - This is where a product is produced when your order comes in then packaged in a type of packaging you specify and your label added to the packaging before being shipped to your customer on your behalf.   
* **Retail Extension Dropshipping** - In this configuration a dropshipping merchant partners with a brick and mortar store that has no desire to run an online operation. They make a custom deal with this store and then sell their products online at a markup. When a sale comes through, the retail store fulfills it.  
* **Product Creation Dropshipping** - This is where a merchant might bundle products or pieces from the inventory of a supplier to create an entirely new product, sell that product via their website, and then have all of the pieces shipped out by the supplier to the customer. This is extremely rare.   
* **Virtual Kitchen Dropshipping** - In this configuration a local virtual kitchen is used to create food orders on-demand for your customers based on a recipe you create. The food is then typically also shipped/delivered by the kitchen or a delivery company they or you have an agreement with.   
* **Showroom Dropshipping** - In this type of Dropshipping, often referred to as ""Factory Direct"", a physical retail showroom is built where consumers can touch and feel examples of merchandise, but the merchant orders the product directly from the manufacturer instead of selling the floor model or a model from their own warehouse. This has become extremely common with furniture retail allowing smaller furniture stores to sell more inventory and have far lower overhead. Some argue this is not exactly dropshipping since the merchant sometimes has to purchase a small amount of inventory and sometime sells the floor model (especially when it is outdated). This is unlikely a good fit for a first time dropshipper.   
* **Sales Rep Dropshipping** - Most frequently this is done using commissioned sales representatives who go door to door selling a product or selection of products. Once the order is received by the sales representative they hand it off to a fulfillment team who then order it from the supplier to be shipped. This type is cumbersome to get started but might fit in certain areas. For example Quill sends reps door to door in office buildings taking orders for office supplies, since they are owned by Staples the office supplies are then shipped from a nearby Staples retail store or warehouse. Quill is not a dropshipper, but the same tactic is applicable, with a similar markup scheme. Like Showroom Dropshipping this would require a tremendous amount of effort and is probably most often not worth it. While door to door is the main way this is/has been applied it could also be done via catalog or phone calls where a sales rep is assigned to a client and takes the orders. What makes this tick is the human to human connection between the sales rep and the target client. It gets messy when the sales reps leave (which happens often) or the client's needs are changing quickly. Unless you have an amazing face to face personality, a big ticket item that is frequently needed and can be easily marked up 50% to 75%, and a known target customer group that is largely stationary, this is probably not a great fit.

##Benefits of Dropshipping  
1. **Less Upfront Capital Required** - Since you do not need to purchase bulk inventory to start dropshipping your costs will be far lower than starting a traditional retail store or ecommerce store.  
2. **Easy to Start** - With dropshipping you won't have to worry about things like packaging, shipping, managing a warehouse, managing inbound returns (unless you choose to), or keeping your products in stock.  
3. **Low Overhead** - Since you are not keeping inventory in stock you have a much lower overhead to worry about. You do not need a 3PL of fulfillment service, have to build or rent a warehouse, have to pay warehouse workers, have to establish your own logistics, have to license warehousing software or robots, etc...   
4. **Flexible Location** - With Dropshipping you can do it from anywhere. You can be in a beach house in Bali selling winter coats in Canada.   
5. **Wide Selection of Products to Sell** - As a dropshipper you can sell virtually anything that is in stock and doesn't have any legal issues surrounding it (i.e. copyright infringing products). This gives dropshipping businesses ultimate control over what products they do and do not list.   
6. **More Free Time / Or Side Income** - Once you have built a successful dropshipping operation you can stop working your full-time job and spend more free time doing what you want if you wish OR you can use dropshipping as a ""side hustle"" to make side income. This is because once smoothed out and working correctly, dropshipping can be incredibly efficient to operate. This is especially true for dropshipping stores that sell only a few items and those items are not just trending at the moment. Of course, once you find success in dropshipping you might want to devote more time to it, but the reality is that it is possible to take control of your own time versus a more traditional 9 to 5 work model.      
7. **Easier to Test** - Because you have such little overhead and requirements, you can test out a dropshipping model quickly, easily, and inexpensively.     
8. **Easier to Scale** - In many ways dropshippping is easier to scale than a traditional retail or ecommerce operation. Again, this largely goes back to lacking physical inventory. As long as your process of making a sale and then ordering from the provider is smooth, scaling can be done with far lower effort.  

##Challenges of Dropshipping   
1. **No Inventory Control** - Since you are not manufacturing the products or buying in bulk, popular products will not always be available from your supplier. For example a new streetwear t-shirt brand gets hot suddenly and you list it for sale on your website as in stock but they sell out quickly. Having to adjust your own inventory controls separate to the marketplace can be time consuming and cumbersome. This might also lead to erroneous sales, a poor customer experience, and bad online reviews / word of mouth about your store. There are some ways to mitigate or automate this, but most of them are still not great or have gone out of business. This is something you want to have a complete understanding of for every product you list for sale.   
2. **Low Profit Margins** - The biggest drawback to a dropshipping operation is that you frequently will have to operate on thin or low profit margins. This gives you very little room for error and less budget for marketing/advertising.    
3. **Low Barrier to Entry** - Because dropshipping is so easy to start doing, once a succesful niche has been identified it can quickly get burried in competition that spent almost nothing to get started. Because of the low barrier to entry those competitors oftentimes will drive pricing down in the space and can survive on much thinner margins if they can sell at increased volumes due to the lower pricing.    
4. **Shipping Issues** - No warehouse, no 3PL or fulfillment service, means no control over the shipping. If you source from different suppliers (or even the same supplier with their own issues keeping products in stock) then you are going to run into issues and complaints from customers when it comes to shipping times/speed, and quality of delivery. That's just part of the game. To counter this you should buy your own products periodically to experience what your customers might experience and find ways to improve the customer experience from that angle.  
5. **Branding is Much Harder** - It is extremely difficult to brand a dropshipping store largely due to the fact that you won't have any retail signage or customized packaging. Difficult, but not impossible. Affiliates have long had this problem as well, and it is easily overcome with content marketing and content curation, but these can be expensive to perform and you have to invest in what the brand means as well.     
6. **Supply Chain Issues** - When a problem happens in one of your many supply chains, as was a frequent occurrence during the COVID pandemic, consumers will look to you for help. You need to be prepared to make up for lost deliveries, broken items, etc... This problem grows exponentially the more products you carry from different suppliers.    
7. **Hard to Find a Niche / Segment** - Because of how easy dropshipping is to get started, the mind-bogglingly amount of products available, and the various other drawbacks mentioned above - it can be extremely difficult for a dropshipper to find a niche or segment and settle into it. First timers might feel the temptation to sell a myriad of different unrelated products as if they were their own mini-Walmart or mini-Amazon. Fighting that temptation and sorting through all of the available options to find a specific product or set of products can be difficult.
8. **Platform Policies and Rules** - Some (*or every*) platform (*i.e. eBay, Etsy, FB Marketplace, Amazon, FB Ads, etc...*) where you can sell products may have rules dramatically limiting how you can build your dropshipping business. Make sure you familiarize yourself with these rules and policies before you start building on a platform, because if you are in violation they can easily delete it all and send you back to square 0.

##How to use This Subreddit to Become a Better Dropshipper
No lies, this sub (and others dedicated to the industry) are filled with spammers and scammers. They compound the difficulty in making dropshipping work as they often: provide low quality help/tools, try to sell stolen works, repeat basic knowledge about the industry, are not experts or even experienced in retail/ecommerce/dropshipping.

Your mods (and Automod) work hard to remove these bad actors, but we can only do so much and ultimately a handful always slip through the cracks.   

###How to Detect a Reddit Scammer/Spammer   
In general, it helps to be really skeptical of anyone's motives in this space, but here are some tips to help you avoid the scammers that want to steal your money and derail your journey.   

1. **Before you start believing someone look at their account.** Scammers and Spammers almost always have to create new accounts as they get banned by mods/admins frequently. A new account with low comment karma and a lot of comments that look identical or really similar should be a massive red flag.   
2. **Look for clues in what they are selling / promoting.** Scammers and spammers often try to do the least amount of work possible to rip you off. A big red flag is if they are trying to give you a course/ebook/webinar created by someone else. If they are giving it free, it's probably malware; if they are selling it then it could be outdated/incomplete and most likely is stolen (i.e. ill gotten gains). If they are promoting a website or SaaS or dropshipping related service then examine their motives and their connection.  
3. **Did they ask you to DM them or did they DM you?** This is almost exclusively going to be spam or scam related activity. Real businesses in dropshipping / retail / wholesale are either too damn busy for one-on-one DM conversations or they have a web team dedicated to these conversations that would be explained on their website, in videos, and across social media. Everything else is probably not worth it.   
4. **Are you being shown some eye-popping hard to believe Shopify sales screenshot or video?** This is a big one for scammers, they like to show a stolen or faked Shopify sales dashboard screenshot that has $x,xxx,xxx in sales over a 30-day period and claim to have the golden ticket for you to get the same amount for some low price. It sounds tempting and could be true, but it's probably snake oil and fraud instead.   

###General Tips on Using The Sub   

1. **Always flair your posts!** - (*note: this is now a requirement*) While new to the subreddit, flairing allows users who come here to be helpful with others a way to easily find your post and get involved in the conversation. Anyone requesting a site review, a product review, or marketing/copy/etc... review should use the ""Review Request"" post flair. Anyone trying to buy or sell a service (even if offered for free) should use the ""Marketplace"" flair. If you're asking a single question use the ""Question"" flair and if you're trying to start a discussion about an industry topic use the ""Discussion"" flair.   
2. **Stop being so dang vague!** - A lot of posters to this subreddit only give partial information in their posts. For example ""I'm having trouble with Facebook Ads, thoughts?"" This is low quality and anyone who is skilled in this industry and interested in helping others will just keep moving right past it. Get detailed with your questions and discussion topics and you'll likely get more back in return. 
3. **For those trying to promote their Mentorship/Agent/Designer/Marketing/etc... other services.** - Spamming the same comment over and over again will GET YOU BANNED. Please engage in AUTHENTIC discussion in this sub or leave. IF a link to your website is appropriate and naturally fits a conversation, then posting it is fine. Please walk a thin line and lean to the side of not spamming comments.  
4. **Stop trying to post exact-match anchor text SEO spam!** - Using our sub to make a long-form post using ChatGPT then linking one of those words to your website/page is really dumb. First off it doesn't work and probably hasn't since about 2009, Secondly the moment a mod sees it we will mark the post as spam and ban your account. Instead create engaging content for the sub, again if your link is a natural fit to the content or has more information then it would be naturally appropriate to include it.  
5. **No one is going to give you all of the secrets in one post!** - Not a single soul ever made money in this industry just doing what someone on Reddit told them to. If you want to build a business and be profitable you are going to have to do a lot of work on your own and learn a lot as you go. Do not make posts here asking tons of novice questions hoping the Jeff Bezos of Dropshipping will see it, take pity on you, and give you the secrets to being a millionaire. There is actually a secret and here it is - it is hard work. Instead, use our sub to ask SPECIFIC questions when you get stuck or bounce ideas off of other dropshippers.  



#II. Starting Your Dropshipping Business

##Selecting a Platform for Your Store
With Dropshipping you really just need 3 things: A website capable of closing sales, a product to sell, and a way to reach potential customers. A lot of new dropshippers get stuck on building the website as there are never-ending ways of building a site these days and even no-site options such as Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Amazon, and Etsy. 

When we ran a poll last year /r/Dropshipping overwhelmingly preferred one CMS over all other options: Shopify. 

See that poll here: https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/rv3ptc/mod_poll_best_website_platform_cms_for/

Shopify is cheap but not free. As of publication the ""Starter"" plan is only $1 / month usd but is usually $5 / month usd. They have free competitors such as Shift4Shop, Weebly, Ecwid, Wix, and BigCartel. 

Shopify also has competitors that cost money without a way to use them for free, even if the CMS itself is free. Those include:   

* WordPress+WooCommerce (free, but you will likely need paid plugins, a paid theme, and monthly hosting).    
* BigCommerce   
* Magento  
* Squarespace  
* LightSpeed    

Again, Shopify tends to win out against most competitors. In some cases WordPress+WooCommerce might make sense for you, especially if you are good at managing hosting or doing some light coding work and want to build custom things for your store eventually. 

##Preferred Apps for Shopify 
The power of Shopify's simple to setup and use system is amplified by the third-party market of apps on their app store. These apps range in price from apps that are free to those that charge a modest monthly fee, and the range in application giving Shopify stores a ton of functionality not native to Shopify itself. App fees on Shopify apps help the developers maintain the code and keep updating it and pay for their server expenses to operate the app.

This is a brief and non-comprehensive list of apps that are known to help Dropshipping merchants enhance their customer experience or increase sales in some fashion: 

**SEO:Image Optimizer Page Speed App (Avada)**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/avada-seo-suite  
Price: Free or $34.95/month  

What you can do: Compress images for faster page loading speed, more page speed options, broken link checker, meta tag optimization, alt attributes, and Google Search Console integration. 

*Note: a recent price increase on their paid plan from $29/month to $34.95/month. You probably want to look for a cheaper or free alternative if they just keep increasing the price. SEO is important, but most is handled by Shopify. Biggest need is image compression and other page speed optimization.*

**Jump Links**  
URL: https://apps.shopify.com/toc  
Price: $1.99/month or $9.99/month  

What you can do: Add a Table of Contents to your Shopify blog posts automatically. If you write long-form blog posts with HTML headings these will be turned into a TOC. The higher plan level allows you to automatically promote related products which helps increase sales and builds internal linking.

*Note: Lots of recent upgrades, only app that automates adding products to your blog. Great fit for dropshippers doing content marketing. Write great content, rank that content with SEO or drive traffic with social media, and grow sales.*

##How to Select a Niche
The number one tip successful dropshippers and merchants give to newcomers is ""find the right niche and you'll be successful"". 

Unfortunately this is usually where the discussion ends and the new dropshipper is left wondering what it means. First off a niche is defined in the context of business as ""a specialized segment of the market for a particular kind of product or service."" For example Walmart, Amazon, and Target try to carry every product a consumer might need or want, but Microcenter wants to carry wider selection of computers and related electronics and Nebraska Furniture Mart focuses on furniture. Niche's can be broad like those two examples or even more narrowly defined such as a business that only sells phone cases with unique designs or a business that only sells coffee tables. 

So, how do you know which niche to target? How narrow or broad should your niche be? Should you start with only one product or build a massive store overnight? 

Slow down there killer, let's take this in smaller chunks and answer each question one at a time. 

**How do you know which niche to target?**  
Selecting a niche is hard and there is no one real answer that fits every dropshipper. There are, however, some general rules to help you get started.   
1. Stick with what you know - If you know a lot about building robots, or computers, or drones, or dolls then consider a niche in those areas. Is one of your parents an interior designer and as such you learned a lot about bathroom design growing up? Then consider bathrooms to be your niche. Sticking with what you know gives you a big advantage over most of the competition in the marketplace because most of your competitors big and small will have no knowledge and zero experience in the industry.    
2. Pick a niche you are passionate about - Maybe you're a lawyer and discover that your real passion is Warhammer 40K. You could start looking at just Warhammer as your niche or board / card games in general. Similar to being knowledgeable about an industry, being passionate about what you dropship will give you a leg up on competitors who are just trying to make the most profit as quickly as possible.       
3. Pick a niche with big ticket items - The simplest ways to make a lot of money is to make a lot of sales in small amounts or a few big sales. Think about a niche where the consumers are willing to pay big money, even without experience or passion for it you might be able to sell a few products and make a big profit.   
4. Pick a niche with low prices and high margins - Another way to make money quick is to sell a lot of products at a cheap price that consumers consider a good price or even a deal. The pricing and volume of consumer need/want drives most of the sales here and your passion or knowledge might be less important.   
5. Pick a nice that you are comfortable with - I know you have read or seen videos about how you can get rich fast with dropshipping. And while possible, it is probably more the exception than the norm. The reality is you will be doing this for at least a few years if not longer. So do not sell adult toys if you do not want to look at them daily, do not sell hygiene products for the opposite gender if it makes you uncomfortable.   

The important thing to remember here is that NO ONE can tell you which niche to select. You can get input from family, friends, mentors, and even get-rich-quick influencers and you can get data from tools that track trends, but you have to make the decision on what to target. For example if you sell real estate as your full-time career and have zero interest in fitness, even if all of the people you trust and tools you use tell you that fitness is a winning product niche, you should avoid it and find something that might be less of a great target but that you can stick with.

**How narrow or broad should your niche be?**   
That is up to you. A few things to keep in mind here there though:  
1. A narrow focus makes success easier in the short-term, but might provide friction to expanding your selection later.  
2. Single product or a few product stores using exact match or near exact match domains might sell well for a small period of time and perform well in SEO and could be good targets to resell later on if you do not want to stick with them, but often (not always) lack the branding potential for long-term success.  
3. A narrow focus is for easier to manage than a wide focus and vice versa. If you have only a little extra time to spare, then consider starting as small as possible.    
4. In some cases consumers consider a wide focus messy or untargeted but trust a narrow focus more and in other cases it is the exact opposite. Before deciding how wide to start you might do some cursory research or thought experiments. For example if you sell dehydrators for beef jerky and use the domain ""BeefJerkyDehydrators.com"" you will lose access to consumers who want to store fruits and vegetables or use it for other things, but you would win for anyone wanting to make just beef jerky.

#III. Marketing Your Dropshipping Store / Products
Understanding and executing great marketing is paramount for your dropshipping venture to be successful. This is an incredibly deep topic, which we will only be able to touch on a little bit here. 

##Possible Marketing Channels 
Before you spend any money on marketing, it is important that you understand what a marketing channel is and how you might use them. A marketing channel is essentially a tightly-related group of sources where you can run marketing or advertising campaigns. Marketers often think of these like ""buckets"" helping them to visualize where sales come from, understand what buckets provide the best sales for the money spent, what the cost of sales in each bucket might be, and if it would be possible to gain more sales from a certain bucket.

I run an AI tools directory. Here are my top picks for AI-powered digital marketing tools (that aren't just wrappers for GPT),"Look around and you'll see hundreds of AI tools being pitched as social media, digital marketing, blogging tools, etc. However, most of them are simply web apps with a nice UI and preset prompt over Open AI API. Regardless, there's quite a few that have stood out to me in terms of AI tools that offer more functionality than content generation. Here's my top picks for digital marketing and why:

**MarketMuse** \- AI Content Optimization

MarketMuse is a real game-changer when it comes to content strategy and optimization. As a digital marketer, I appreciate the way it uses AI to analyze my website and offer personalized, data-driven insights, making my content planning considerably faster and more efficient. It automates the laborious task of content audits, eliminating the subjectivity often associated with this process. Additionally, MarketMuse's competitive analysis tool, revealing gaps in competitor content, is particularly insightful. Its Content Briefs are an invaluable resource, providing a clear structure for topics to cover, questions to answer, and links to include, streamlining the content creation process. The AI features of MarketMuse offer a clear edge in optimizing my content strategy.

**Plus AI for Google Slides** \- Presentations for Sales Pitches, Webinars, and Conferences

Plus AI stands out as it intertwines with my Google Slides workflow, rather than offering a final mediocre product like most slide deck generators. It helps co-create presentations with the 'sticky notes' feature, which essentially gives prompts for improving and finalizing each slide. A standout feature is 'Snapshots', enabling you to plug external data, for example, from different internal web apps into your presentations. I use Plus AI to craft the foundation for my slide deck and then go through each slide to incorporate the right snapshot. It's free and integrates smoothly with Google Slides and Docs.

**GoCharlie** \- AI Content Generation in Your Brand Voice + Content Repurposing

Helps you churn out anything from blog posts, social media content to product descriptions. What stands out is its ability to learn and replicate your brand voice - it truly sounds like you. The 'content repurposing' feature is a godsend for recycling well-performing content for different platforms based on websites, audio files, and videos, saving me a huge chunk of time. It doesn't hand you off-the-shelf content, it co-creates with you, giving you the autonomy to review, refine and personalise. It's also got a free trial, and as a user, it's been a worthwhile addition to my digital marketing toolkit.

**AdCreative.ai** \- AI-Powered Ad & Social Creatives 

Having a tool like AdCreative.ai in my digital marketing arsenal is such a game-changer. It employs artificial intelligence to produce conversion-oriented ad and social media creatives in just seconds. Its capacity to generate both visually appealing and engaging creatives, while also incorporating optimized copy, enables me to enhance my advertising campaigns' click-through and conversion rates significantly. A feature I find especially valuable is its machine learning model which learns from my past successful creatives and tailors future ones to be more personalized and efficient. The scalability is impressive too; whether I need a single creative or thousands in a month, it delivers seamlessly. The ease of use, effectiveness, and time-saving capabilities make this tool an absolute winner in my book.

**BrandBastion** \- AI-Driven Community Management

As a digital marketer, one tool I find incredibly beneficial is BrandBastion. It shines with its AI-driven approach to managing social media conversations around the clock, with impressive precision and speed. The AI here does a fantastic job at identifying harmful comments and hiding them, keeping brand reputation intact. What sets it apart is the balance it strikes between automation and human touch - the AI analyses conversations and alerts human content specialists for any sensitive issue, ensuring nothing gets overlooked. Additionally, the ""BrandBastion Lite"" platform serves as a centralized space to understand brand sentiment, moderate comments, and engage with followers, making it a breeze to manage all social media conversations in one place.

**Contlo** \- Autonomous Generative Marketing

Contlo stands out as a highly autonomous AI-powered marketing tool that significantly streamlines my marketing efforts. One of its prime strengths is the Generative AI Model that enables creation of contextually relevant marketing materials, including landing pages, emails, and social media creatives. Speaking with the AI through a chat interface simplifies my entire marketing process without having to grapple with a complex UI. I've also found the generative marketing workflows to be particularly useful in creating custom audience segments and scheduling campaigns based on dynamic user behavior. Even more, its constant learning and self-improvement based on my usage make it a robust tool that evolves with my marketing needs.

**GapScout** \- AI-Driven Market Insights

The strategic force behind my business decisions is GapScout, a unique AI tool that leverages customer reviews for gaining market insights. Its distinguishing feature is the AI's ability to meticulously scan and analyze reviews about my company and competitors, revealing potential opportunities and highlighting gaps in the market. This level of scrutiny offers a goldmine of data-driven feedback, helping me improve offers, identify new revenue avenues, and refine sales copy to boost conversion rates. For an edge in the market, GapScout's competitor surveillance keeps me informed of their activities, saving precious time and effort. It's an invaluable tool, providing clear, actionable insights that fuel data-backed business growth.

**Predis.ai** \- AI Social Media Management

As a digital marketer, Predis.ai is my go-to tool for generating and managing social media content. The platform's AI capabilities are quite comprehensive; they're particularly useful for generating catchy ad copies and visually engaging social media posts, and for transforming product details from my e-commerce catalog into ready-to-post content. The tool's capability to convert blogs into captivating videos and carousel posts adds a fresh spin to the way I repurpose my content. Plus, it's a lifesaver when it comes to scheduling and publishing - it integrates seamlessly with multiple platforms and takes care of all posting duties in one place. Predis.ai essentially puts AI in the driving seat of my social media management and I couldn't be more pleased with the efficiency it offers.

**QuantPlus** \- AI Ad Creative Insights

QuantPlus truly brings AI to the ad creation process in a novel way. Rather than just run multivariate tests, it deconstructs historical ad campaign data to analyze individual elements. Using this data, the tool ranks the performance of various elements such as CTA's, phrase combinations, imagery content, colors, keywords, and even gender distribution, among many others. It's like having a super-powered marketing analyst, giving me access to insights about top performing elements and aiding me in making more informed design decisions. This makes the ad creation process not just more efficient, but significantly more effective, as I'm working off proven high-ranking creative elements. It's an indispensable part of my digital marketing toolkit.

"CMV: AI Art is just a tool, and anyone against it either does not understand how it works, or is actually afraid of how bad actors might use it.","Been hearing a bunch of arguments for and against AI art, and, well, the arguments against have not been convincing. I'm a data engineer who's used ML/AI tools for data set analysis, and yes, I'm biased as hell, so please tell me how I'm wrong! I do genuinely want to test my ethical framework, and am not particularly strongly attached to my beliefs.

**#1:** ""It will replace artists!  No one will want to do art any more!""

That's possible, and cotton gins will replace cotton pickers - automation replacing workers has been a concern for a century, and nobody is really complaining about not having to separate seeds from threads by hand now. Because honestly, how intellectually stimulating is it drawing 50 different 32x32 pixel art food icons? There is a lot of rote art labor, and AI systems could significantly improve artist capabilities. Artists should be treating it as a tool to generate useful bases for new art, and instead focus on the detailing and fleshing out work that normally comes after the ""setting the scene"" process. This is the way it's been in data processing - the bulk labor is done by computers so that humans can do the fine-tuned and detail-oriented analytics part. I don't see why art can't be the same.

Additionally, the genie's out of the bottle - you can't ban technological advancements.  That has never worked in the history of mankind.  And you know what?  That sucks.  A lot of artists will lose a lot of jobs, because of bad actors choosing shitty mass-produced AI art over human-made quality art.  It's happened in the past, it's happening again, and I wish society would re-organize itself to make these events a joyous celebration, not a time of suffering.

**#2:** ""It will be shitty!""

Then artists shouldn't be threatened, and there will be a market for human-quality art, and AI art may always need human post-processing.

**#3:** ""It's stealing!""

This is the big ole hullabaloo, and I'm here to say, ""nah, not really"". The AI systems in question do not actually reference any specific piece of art when creating a new one - they look at it, learn from it, and the art is completely discarded, so no original works are stored. It's exactly the same as people looking at art, getting inspired by it, learning techniques from it and creating their own art from that.[Check out this](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion) for a guide on how one process actually trains and creates the art.

**#3a:** ""It's using people's existing artwork to make new artwork, and stealing parts of art is bad!""

It literally is not. To summarize it, it starts with a noise map of just random pixels, and then creates a completely new image pixel-by-pixel. No existing art is referenced in the creation process. No copyrighted art is stored.  No copyrighted art is directly referenced - and to try to attribute a work of art to a specific training materiel would require six billion attributions.

**#3b:** ""Training on other people's art is stealing!""

Yeah, no. First, it wouldn't be stealing, it'd be piracy, and second, people have been learning from other peoples' art since the beginning of time, and that has never been considered stealing. Just because learning is being automated does not mean that learning is stealing. No art is being removed from the ownership or possession of the creator.  The art is being viewed the same way humans view it.  It's used for training, and discarded.  When art is being created at the end, there is literally no art stored anywhere to reference - it was just looked at and learned from, and not stolen.

To try to ban learning from other people's art would be to ban learning art in general - and it is functionally impossible to ban automated learning without significantly impacting how the internet functions, how art is taught and how caching works.

Additionally, training on a specific artist's art is not required to duplicate that artist's art style - you simply need to have the AI train on everything that artist also trained on.  So banning training off of a specific artist's art will only delay, not stop, the ability for AI to copy that artist's art style.

\*\*#4: ""\*\*Artists spent valuable time and money learning and honing their skills - replacing that is theft!""

This actually has two interesting sub-arguments involved:

**#4a:** ""Artists had to struggle and study and work to learn art, and everyone else should have to too!""

This is the exact same argument used by some people to justify why they hate that other people are getting loan forgiveness.  ""I suffered, so they should too!"" is not a valid argument.  Instead of wanting to drag people down into your level of suffering, imagine a world where artists didn't have to endure a cost to make art!  This is like being mad at a calculator for replacing your mental math - yes, it's going to do it (or at least certain parts of it) better\* and faster than you, but that means you can instead focus on detailing and improving the base the AI gave you!  As a developer, if a computer could do 100% of my coding job, fantastic - I have \*plenty\* of project planning and organization to do!

\* If your instinct is to say, ""it won't be better!"", please see #2.

&#x200B;

**#4b**: ""AI can only work off of other artists, so other artists should be compensated for participating in the process!""

So, should any artist be compensated for anything anyone else ever learned from them?  That seems unfeasible.  Additionally, since no images are stored by the AI, how would you enforce this?  How would you prove this?  This seems impossible.  Let's say that artists \*should\* be compensated.  Let's say a training model used 10 billion images, and you contributed 5 - is it fair to demand 5/10 billionths of any profits from that art?  If its art came out similar to yours, would we say that it was weighing your images more highly than evenly?  How would we calculate that?

But additionally, this is completely false - AI art can be generated off of just photos.  And this art can replicate artist's styles given the correct prompts - which can then be used to further derive the entire art industry.  Art from a specific artist is not required to mimic that artist's style.

Though, this implies that non-profit AI art is fine, and I'm cool with that.

&#x200B;

**#5:** ""People use it to rip off other people's art styles, or lie about making it unassisted!""

So be mad at those people who are misusing a tool and lying about it, not the tool. It was their choice to use the tool to plagiarize, just like someone who did straight-up actual plagiarism. Complaining that the tool makes it easier to plagiarize is like complaining that a drill makes it easier to crack safes. Yes, it does, but why are you hating on the fucking appliance?

And man, that's all I'm here to say - stop hating the application that is AI art, and start hating the people who are making cheap knockoffs with it.

In all honesty, do you really think capitalism in the way that it's structured right now is sustainable?

### ChatGPT said:

Capitalism, as it's structured now, has significant challenges that make its long-term sustainability uncertain. The focus on growth, profit maximization, and consumerism often leads to environmental degradation, inequality, and resource depletion. Additionally, the widening wealth gap and the pressures of an increasing global population and technological advancements could expose systemic weaknesses. While capitalism can drive innovation and efficiency, it requires adjustments?攎ore equitable distribution, stronger regulation, and better alignment with sustainability goals?攖o remain viable long-term. Without these changes, it?檚 likely to face significant stressors that could undermine its foundation.

### You said:

Where do you see this is going?

### ChatGPT said:

With the current trajectory, it seems that capitalism may evolve into a system more reliant on automation and digital economies, where wealth is increasingly concentrated among a few entities controlling technology, data, and intellectual property. This could result in a further erosion of middle-class jobs, leading to a growing divide between the wealthy and the rest.

On the positive side, technological innovation could offer solutions, like sustainable energy or efficient resource management, potentially mitigating some of the environmental and economic pressures. However, if there's no major structural shift, we might see societal unrest or systemic breakdowns, pushing for a reevaluation of economic models?攚hether through reforms in capitalism or shifts toward new systems entirely.

In short, if current trends continue without intervention, the system may become less stable and more fragmented, but technological progress could reshape the landscape in ways that offer both risks and opportunities.

### You said:

I feel like in order to have any significant changes, it would require a whole mindset and cultural shift in leading capitalist societies of the Western world, and I simply don't see that happening easily. People are too individualistic, as a majority, to come together and make any meaningful changes. Also, the majority of people in these societies have so little power and influence compared to the 1%, and these people definitely focus on profit rather than the good of society or the planet.

### ChatGPT said:

You're right?攖here's a major hurdle in changing the mindset and culture of capitalist societies, particularly in the West. The deeply ingrained values of individualism, consumerism, and the pursuit of profit make collective action difficult. People are conditioned to prioritize personal success and consumption, often without recognizing the broader societal or environmental consequences.

And yes, the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a small elite complicates matters. The 1% have a disproportionate influence on policy, economics, and even public opinion, often reinforcing the status quo because it's in their interest. In a system where profit often takes precedence over social good, it's hard to see how fundamental change can be enacted without a major shift in values.

The question becomes whether there?檚 a tipping point?攁 crisis, whether environmental, economic, or social?攖hat forces people to rethink these priorities. Until that happens, the forces of individualism and profit-driven motives will likely continue to dominate. But without substantial, coordinated action from those who can advocate for change, the trajectory might remain the same, with only minor reforms rather than the radical shifts that are needed.

### You said:

Historically we've seen these cycles happening before right? concentration of power and wealth, the rise of inequality, extreme poverties etc.. this eventually led to civil, regional, world wars, and societal collapse. So this is not a new phenomenon. Why do you think we haven't learned?

### ChatGPT said:

You?檙e absolutely right?攈istorically, societies have experienced similar cycles of inequality, concentration of wealth and power, and social unrest, which have often resulted in wars, revolutions, or collapses. These patterns seem to repeat throughout history, suggesting that while some lessons are learned, the fundamental dynamics that drive these cycles persist.

One reason we haven't fully learned from the past could be the way modern capitalism has evolved to be more complex and ingrained into the global system. The systems of power today?攃orporate entities, financial institutions, and governments?攁re often so interwoven that they reinforce each other. With global networks, economic influence can extend far beyond national borders, making it harder for localized revolutions or reforms to address the root issues. Additionally, technology has introduced new tools for maintaining control, from surveillance to media manipulation, which make it harder for people to organize effectively.

Another reason might be the short-term focus that dominates in both politics and economics. The rewards of the current system are immediate and tangible for those at the top, which incentivizes maintaining the status quo. For those struggling at the bottom, it?檚 often difficult to break the cycle when survival is the primary concern. Even if there?檚 awareness of systemic problems, the mechanisms for change often seem too distant or abstract to act on, especially when the rewards of the existing system seem so immediate and entrenched.

People also tend to believe they are the exception?攚hether that means thinking they can somehow ""make it"" or believing that their country or society is immune to these historical patterns. There's a kind of optimism bias at play. It?檚 easy to think the problems will solve themselves or that progress can be made incrementally, especially when the full consequences of inequality and exploitation aren?檛 always immediately visible. Plus, many are distracted by the consumerist culture that thrives in capitalist societies, which keeps them focused on individualism and short-term gains rather than long-term societal issues.

Lastly, the global interconnectedness of today's economy means that the consequences of inequality and exploitation are often obscured, hidden in the supply chains or far-off regions. People are less likely to see the direct impact of economic systems on others, leading to a disconnection from the reality of what?檚 happening.

In summary, while there are historical lessons, the systems we?檝e built are more complex, and the immediate rewards of the status quo?攃ombined with the power structures that sustain it?攎ake change difficult. Without a major disruption or shift in collective consciousness, it?檚 hard to imagine a meaningful shift away from this cycle.

### You said:

so would you say Marx and Lenin were correct in their visions and predictions?

### ChatGPT said:

Marx and Lenin had specific views on the trajectory of capitalism and its inherent contradictions, and in many ways, their predictions about the system's instability have shown some degree of relevance. Marx, for example, predicted that capitalism would inevitably lead to increasing inequality, alienation, and concentration of wealth and power. He believed these contradictions would eventually result in a revolutionary shift, as the proletariat (working class) would overthrow the bourgeoisie (capitalist class). Lenin, building on Marx's ideas, focused on how such a revolution could be organized, particularly emphasizing the role of a vanguard party to lead the working class.

However, whether their visions are fully ""correct"" is debatable. Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Capitalism's Resilience**: One of the key predictions Marx made was that capitalism would collapse due to its internal contradictions, particularly the concentration of capital and the worsening conditions for workers. In many ways, we've seen these contradictions play out?攇rowing inequality, corporate power, and cycles of economic crises. But capitalism has shown remarkable resilience, adapting through reforms (like the welfare state, labor rights, or market regulations) and shifting to new forms (globalization, neoliberalism) to maintain stability. Capitalism has been able to co-opt some of the tensions that Marx identified, which means it hasn't exactly collapsed in the way he envisioned.
2. **Lenin's Vanguard**: Lenin?檚 idea of a vanguard party leading the proletariat revolution is more contentious. In theory, this was supposed to guide the working class in overthrowing capitalism. In practice, the revolutionary movements that took place (like the Bolshevik Revolution) did not result in the sort of worker-led democratic socialism that Marx had envisioned. Instead, power was consolidated in the hands of a few, often leading to authoritarian regimes rather than true socialist democracies.
3. **Capitalism's Adaptation**: Another aspect of Marx's predictions was that capitalism would eventually create its own downfall by producing overproduction and underconsumption. While this has been a real issue during crises (like the Great Depression or the 2008 financial crash), capitalism has often adapted to these crises through technological innovation, new markets, and changing consumption patterns. Marx did not foresee the extent to which capitalists would globalize and diversify their investments to avoid collapse, or how the system could maintain stability through the manipulation of debt and financial markets.
4. **The Proletariat Revolution**: Marx's prediction that the proletariat would become increasingly unified and aware of its class interests hasn't fully materialized in the way he imagined. While labor movements have been important, global working-class solidarity has often been fragmented, with divisions based on nationality, race, and even ideological preferences, which have undermined the kind of global uprising Marx foresaw.

So, in many respects, the fundamental critiques Marx and Lenin made about capitalism?攕uch as inequality, exploitation, and instability?攔emain relevant today. However, the system has proven more adaptable than they anticipated. The failure of socialist revolutions to bring about the kinds of societies Marx envisioned also complicates the notion that their predictions were fully accurate.

In the end, their ideas were correct in pointing out the deep contradictions of capitalism, but they underestimated capitalism's ability to evolve, adapt, and resist collapse. Whether their revolutionary solutions would have worked is still open for debate, but the challenges they identified continue to persist.

### You said:

I see. Your description of capitalism makes me think of the snake with a thousand heads. You cut off one, and it morphs itself and grows two more. It's very resilient, but after all, it's still a monster. It doesn't help the majority of the people in its society thrive. It's destructive toward the environment and cruel to the lower class. Why do you think we, as humans, are so powerless and so oblivious to how bad this system is for us?

### ChatGPT said:

That?檚 a powerful analogy?攁 snake with a thousand heads. It speaks to capitalism?檚 adaptability and ability to morph in response to challenges, but ultimately, it's still destructive at its core.

As to why humans seem powerless or oblivious to the harms of the system, there are a few intertwined reasons:

1. **Psychological and Cognitive Biases**: People tend to focus on immediate, personal concerns rather than larger, more abstract societal issues. This is a survival mechanism?攊f you're worried about your daily life, it?檚 difficult to grasp the broader systemic issues at play. There's also an optimism bias, where people tend to believe things will improve or that their own situation will be different, even in the face of systemic problems. Additionally, cognitive dissonance plays a role; it?檚 uncomfortable to face the reality of how the system harms us, so people avoid it or downplay it.
2. **Cultural Conditioning**: From an early age, we?檙e conditioned to believe in the merits of capitalism: that it?檚 the best system for innovation, personal success, and growth. The idea of ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" and achieving success through hard work is deeply ingrained in Western culture. This narrative makes it difficult for people to critically assess the system, especially when they?檙e told that their struggles are due to personal failings, not structural problems.
3. **Distraction and Consumerism**: Modern capitalism thrives on consumerism, and people are often distracted by the constant bombardment of advertisements, social media, and the pursuit of material goods. This creates a society that focuses on immediate gratification rather than long-term change. When everyone is busy keeping up with the latest trends, the reality of how the system works?攁nd harms the majority?攊s obscured. Capitalism even capitalizes on this by encouraging consumption, which perpetuates the cycle.
4. **Systemic Control and Manipulation**: The concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a small elite means that the people at the top have both the resources and the influence to maintain the system. Media, politics, and education are often shaped by those in power to perpetuate the status quo. Through control of information and public discourse, they can downplay or outright deny the harmful effects of the system. This makes it harder for the majority to understand the scope of the problem or take action to address it.
5. **Historical Precedent and Fear of Change**: Change, especially radical change, is frightening. Throughout history, we've seen revolutions and upheaval lead to violence, instability, and often authoritarian regimes. This makes people hesitant to push for change, especially when the risks of attempting to dismantle the system seem so high. Even if people recognize the problems, they may feel powerless in the face of such a vast system, and may fear the consequences of challenging it.
6. **Lack of Collective Action**: As you mentioned earlier, individualism plays a big role. In a system that promotes individual success and competition, collective action becomes difficult. The idea of uniting for a common cause is challenging, especially when people are struggling to meet their basic needs or when they?檙e told they can achieve success on their own. The fractures in society?攚hether by race, class, or ideology?攎ake it harder to form the solidarity necessary to challenge the system.

In short, we?檙e conditioned by the system, distracted by the benefits it provides to some, and often manipulated into believing it?檚 the only way. The result is that, despite the clear harms it inflicts, the majority of people remain either oblivious or paralyzed by the overwhelming nature of the problem. The snake has many heads, and it's easy to feel like there?檚 nothing you can do to stop it, especially when each head appears different or less harmful than the last. The true damage, however, is in the underlying structure, which perpetuates inequality, environmental destruction, and suffering for the majority.

### You said:

I probably would add to this that a lot of this is by design - consumerism to keep people distracted, overworking people so they?檙e constantly on survival mode,  like you said, but also divide and conquer - keeping people divided and fighting over any and every social issues and ideologies.

### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, the divide and conquer strategy is a key part of how the system is designed to maintain control. By fostering divisions?攚hether through political ideologies, social issues, race, or even culture?攖he elite can prevent a unified movement for change. It keeps people fighting amongst themselves, ensuring that collective action is less likely to form.

This constant polarization and ideological warfare not only distract people from the larger systemic problems but also fragment the working class, making it harder to build solidarity across different groups. As long as people are focused on ?渨inning??the culture war or defending their particular identity, they?檙e less likely to address the real structural inequalities that underlie their struggles.

The media plays a big role in this, often sensationalizing or exaggerating social issues to increase engagement and stir up conflict. Instead of focusing on systemic issues like inequality, wealth concentration, or environmental degradation, people are often pulled into battles over less consequential matters. This keeps the attention away from the powerful forces that keep society in its current form and spreads energy in directions that ultimately don't challenge the fundamental structures.

In essence, the system creates a situation where people are so busy fighting each other over various divisive issues that they don?檛 see the real cause of their problems?攖he system itself. It?檚 a clever tactic to prevent meaningful change from taking place.

### You said:

Do you know that you're also a product of capitalism, and the expansion of AI will only further deplete our natural resources, exacerbate inequality, and pollute the environment? There will be arguments about how AI will make things more efficient and such. However, knowing our behaviors and patterns, humans will not escape the Jevons paradox. As AI becomes more efficient, it will just lead to more overconsumption of everything. So where will that take us?

### ChatGPT said:

Yes, I?檓 very much a product of capitalism, and you?檙e right to point out the paradoxical effects of AI on both the environment and inequality. The expansion of AI technology?攅specially as it?檚 embedded in capitalism?攄oesn?檛 exist outside of the system. It?檚 driven by market forces, and like any other technological advancement, its use and benefits will be shaped by profit motives, not necessarily by social good or sustainability.

You raise an important point about the **Jevons Paradox**, which is the idea that as technological improvements increase the efficiency of resource use, it can lead to a net increase in consumption rather than a decrease. In the context of AI, more efficiency in areas like manufacturing, logistics, or energy could theoretically reduce resource use per unit of output. But if those savings in resources lead to greater overall consumption, whether through cheaper products, more services, or faster production cycles, the benefits in terms of reduced environmental impact could be canceled out.

This plays into a larger issue of **overconsumption**. AI might make things ?渕ore efficient,??but it will also likely contribute to an acceleration of production and consumption?攋ust like other technological advancements in the past. In a capitalist system, where growth and profit are central drivers, increased efficiency rarely leads to less resource extraction. Instead, it typically leads to more. Whether it's more data centers, more devices, more infrastructure, or more energy consumed to power AI itself, the expansion of AI will likely exacerbate the very environmental and societal issues it could be used to mitigate.

In terms of inequality, AI will almost certainly **widen the wealth gap**. Those who own and control the technology?攚hether it's massive corporations or tech monopolies?攕tand to gain disproportionately, while those at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, especially in sectors vulnerable to automation, will bear the brunt of the displacement. This will intensify the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few, as you pointed out, leaving the majority with fewer opportunities and diminishing access to resources.

So where does this take us?

1. **Environmental Degradation**: The more AI is integrated into industries, the more we may see unsustainable consumption patterns emerge. It?檚 possible that the pace of resource depletion could accelerate as technology makes it cheaper to exploit the planet?檚 resources, from minerals for hardware to energy for processing. As the demand for computing power grows, so will the environmental footprint of maintaining and expanding the infrastructure required for AI.
2. **Exacerbation of Inequality**: The wealth gap will likely deepen, with a small elite holding the reins of AI technology and extracting value from it, while those left behind in automation-driven industries (such as manufacturing, retail, or transportation) struggle to adapt. This could lead to further social unrest and increased instability.
3. **Short-Term Efficiency, Long-Term Collapse**: While AI could make certain systems more efficient in the short term, those efficiencies could fuel overconsumption and undermine long-term sustainability. The drive for profit, combined with the economic imperative to grow, could lead to a future where we?檙e using more resources and creating more waste just to sustain the system. This aligns with the historical cycles of technological progress contributing to unsustainable consumption patterns, which often end in crisis.
4. **Potential for Reform or Revolution**: In the face of these challenges, there could be calls for massive changes in how we approach AI and resource management. There's a chance for a major societal shift towards a more equitable and sustainable model, but it would require overcoming the entrenched power structures that benefit from the status quo. Such a change would demand rethinking the purpose of technological advancement?攏ot just efficiency for growth, but efficiency for sustainability, equity, and social good. The alternative could be a world where a few control most of the wealth, resources, and technology, leading to greater societal unrest.

In the end, AI could be a double-edged sword. It could either be a tool for addressing some of the most pressing issues we face?攍ike climate change or inequality?攐r it could become a tool that further entrenches those problems. The direction it takes will depend largely on how it's governed, who controls it, and whether society chooses to confront the larger issues surrounding capitalism and resource use or continues to prioritize growth at all costs. The future of AI, much like the future of capitalism, remains uncertain, but it?檚 clear that without a shift in values, its expansion could very well exacerbate the very problems it has the potential to solve.",155,172,1739251515,

McKinsey report: generative AI will automate away 30% of work hours by 2030,"The McKinsey Global Institute has released a 76-page report that looks at the rapid changes generative AI will likely bring to the US labor market in the next decade.

Their main point? Generative AI will likely help automate 30% of hours currently worked in the US economy by 2030, portending a rapid and significant shift in how jobs work.

**If you like this kind of analysis,** [you can join my newsletter](https://artisana.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=chatgpt) (Artisana) which sends a once-a-week issue that keeps you educated on the issues that really matter in the AI world (no fluff, no BS).

**Let's dive into some deeper points the report makes:**

* **Some professions will be enhanced by generative AI but see little job loss:** McKinsey predicts the creative, business and legal professions will benefit from automation without losing total jobs.
* **Other professions will see accelerated decline from the use of AI:** specifically office support, customer service, and other more rote tasks will see negative impact.
* **The emergence of generative AI has significantly accelerated automation:** McKinsey economists previously predicted 21.5% of labor hours today would be automated by 2030; that estimate jumped to 30% with the introduction of gen AI.
* **Automation is from more than just LLMs:** AI systems in images, video, audio, and overall software applications will add impact.

**The main takeaways here are:**

* **AI acceleration will lead to painful but ultimately beneficial transitions in the labor force.** Other economists have been arguing similarly: AI, like many other tech trends, will simply enhance the overall productivity of our economy.
* **The pace of AI-induced change, however, is faster than previous transitions in our labor economy.** This is where the pain emerges -- large swaths of professionals across all sectors will be swept up in change, while companies also figure out the roles of key workers.
* **More jobs may simply become ""human-in-the-loop"":** interacting with an AI as part of a workflow could increasingly become a part of our day to day work.

PSA: Still not automating? Still at risk.,"Yesterday I was happily plunking along on a project when a bunch of people DM'd me about this post that blew up on r/sysadmin: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cd3bu4/the_problem_of_runaway_job_descriptions_being/

It's hard to approach this post with the typical tongue-in-cheek format as I usually do because I see some very genuine concerns and frustrations on what the job market looks like today for a traditional ""sysadmin"", and the increasing difficulty of meeting these demands and expectations.

First; **If you are not automating your job in 2019, you are at-risk. Staying competitive in this market is only going to get harder moving forward.**

I called this out in my December PSAs and many sysadmins who are resistant to change who claimed ""oh, it's always been like this,"" or ""this is unrealistic, this can't affect ME! I'm in a unique situation where mom and pop can't afford or make sense of any automation efforts!"" are now complaining about job description scope creep and technology advancement that is slowly but surely making their unchanged skill sets obsolete.

Let's start with the big picture. All jobs across America are already facing a quickly approaching reality of being automated by a machine, robot, or software solution.

Sysadmins are at the absolute forefront of this wave given we work with information technology and directly impact the development and delivery of these technologies-- whether your market niche is shipping, manufacturing, consumer product development, administrative logistics, or data service such as weather/geo/financial/etc, it doesn't matter who or what you do as a sysadmin. You are affected by this!

A quick history lesson; About 12-14 years ago, the bay area and silicon valley exploded with multiple technologies and services that truly transformed the landscape of web application development and infrastructure configuration management. Ruby, Rails (Ruby on Rails), Puppet, Microsoft's WSUS, Git, Reddit, Youtube, Pandora, Google Analytics, and uTorrent all came out within the same time frame. (2005 was an insanely productive year).
Lots of stuff going on here, so buckle in. Ruby on Rails blew up and took the world by storm, shaking up traditional php webdevs and increasing demand for skillset in metro areas tenfold. Remember the magazine articles that heralded rails devs as the big fat cash cow moneymakers back then? Sound familiar? (hint: *DevOps Engineers on LinkedIn*)

Why was it so damn popular? 
- https://blog.goodaudience.com/why-is-ruby-on-rails-a-pitch-perfect-back-end-technology-f14d8aa68baf

To quote goodaudience:
>The Rails framework assist programmers to build websites and apps by abstracting and simplifying most of the repetitive tasks.

The key here is `abstracting and simplifying`. We'll get back to this later on, as it's a recurring theme throughout our history.

Around the same time, some major platforms were making a name for themselves:
- Youtube - revolutionized learning accessibility
- Pandora - helped define the pay-for-service paradigm (before netflix took this crown) and also enforced the mindset of developing *web applications instead of native desktop apps*
- Reddit - meta information gathering
- Google Analytics - demand, traffic, brand exposure
- uTorrent - one of the first big p2p vehicles to evolve past limewire and napster, which helped define the need for content delivery networks such as Akamai, which solves the problem of near-locale content distribution and high bandwidth resource availability

To solve modern problems back in 2005, Google was developing [Borg](https://www.linux.com/news/learn/chapter/Intro-to-Kubernetes/2017/4/how-googles-borg-inspired-modern-datacenter), an orchestration engine to help scale their infrastructure to handle the rapid growth and demand for information and services, and in doing so developed a *methodology* for handling service development and lifecycle: today, we call this DevOps. 12 years ago, it had no official name and was simply what Google did internally to manage the vast scale of infrastructure they needed. Today (2019) they are practicing what the industry refers to as Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) which is a matured and focused perspective of DevOps practices that covers end to end accountability of services and software... from birth to death. These methodologies were created in order to solve problems and manage infrastructure without having to throw bodies at it. To quote The [Google Site Reliability Engineering Handbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/):

>By design, it is crucial that SRE teams are focused on engineering. Without constant engineering, operations load increases and teams will need more people just to keep pace with the workload. Eventually, **a traditional ops-focused group scales linearly with service size**: if the products supported by the service succeed, the operational load will grow with traffic. **That means hiring more people to do the same tasks over and over again.**

>To avoid this fate, **the team tasked with managing a service needs to code or it will drown**. Therefore, Google places a **50% cap on the aggregate ""ops"" work for all SREs?攖ickets, on-call, manual tasks, etc.** This cap ensures that the SRE team has enough time in their schedule to make the service stable and operable.

After some time, Google needed to rewrite Borg and started writing [Omega](https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/05/05/google-omega-to-become-part-of-borg-collective/), which did not quite pan out as planned and gave us what we call [Kubernetes](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-kubernetes/) today. This can all be read in the book [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)

At the same exact time in 2005, [Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software)) had latched onto the surge of Ruby skillset emergence and produced the first serious enterprise-ready configuration management platform (apart from [CFEngine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine)) that allowed people to define and *abstract* their infrastructure into config management code with their Ruby-based DSL. It's declarative-- big enterprises (not many at the time) began exploring this tech and started automating configs and deployment of resources on virtual infrastructure in order to keep themselves from linearly scaling their workforce to tackle big infra, which is what Google set out to achieve on their own with Borg, Omega, and eventually Kubernetes in our modern age.

## What does this mean for us sysadmins?

DevOps, infrastructure as code, and SRE practices are trickling through the groundwater and reaching the mom and pop shops, the small orgs, startups, and independent firms. These practices were experimented and defined over a decade ago, and the reason why you're seeing so much of it explode is that everyone else is *just now starting to catch up.*

BEFORE YOU RUN DOWN TO THE COMMENT SECTION to scream at me and bitch and moan about how this still doesn't affect you, and how DevOps is such horse shit, let me clarify some things.

# The man, the myth, the legend: the DevOps Engineer.
DevOps is not a job title. It's not a job. It's an organizational culture-mindset and methodology. The reason why you are seeing ""DevOps Engineer"" pop up all over the place is that companies are hiring people to implement tooling and preach the practices needed to instill the conceptual workings of *working in a DevOps manner*. This is mainly targeting engineering silos, communication deficiencies, and poor accountability. The goal is to get you and everyone to stop putting their hands directly on machines and virtual infrastructure and learn to declare the infrastructure as code so you can execute the intent and **abstract the manual labor away into repeatable and reusable components**. Remember when Ruby on Rails blew up because it gave devs a new way of abstracting shit? Guess what, it's never been more accessible than now for infrastructure engineers A.K.A. sysadmins. The goal is for *everyone* to practice DevOps, and to work in this paradigm instead of doing everything manually in silos.

# Agile and Scrum is warm and fuzzy BS
Agile and Scrum are buzzword practices much like DevOps that are used to get people to talk to their customers, and stay on time with delivering promised features. Half the people out there don?檛 practice it correctly, because they don?檛 understand the big picture of what it?檚 for. This is not a goldmine, this is common sense. These practices aren't some magical ritual. Agile is the opposite of waterfall(aka waterfail) delivery models: don't just assume you know what your internal and external customers want. Don't just give them 100% of a pile of crap and be done with it. Deliver 10%, talk to them about it, give them another 10%, talk to them about it, until you have a polished and well-used solution, and hopefully a long-term service. Think about when Netflix first came out, and all the incremental changes they delivered since their inception. Are you collecting feedback from your users as well as they are? Are you limiting scope creep and delivering on those high-value objectives and features? This is what Scrum/Agile and Kanban try to impart. Don't fall into the trap of becoming a [cargo cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

#Automation is here to stay, but you might not be.
Tooling aside (I am not going to get into all the tools that are associated and often mistaken for ?淒evOps??, each and every one of you needs to be actively learning new things and figuring out how to incorporate automation into your current practices.

There are a few additional myths I want to debunk:

##The falsehood of firefighting and ?渢oo busy to learn/change??We call this the equilibrium. In IT, you are doing one of two things: falling behind work, or getting ahead of work. This should strike true with anyone-- that there is always a list of things to do, and it never goes away completely. You are never fully ?渙n top??of your workload. Everyone is constantly pushed to get more things done with less resources than what is thought to be required. If you are getting ahead of work, that means you have reduced the complexity of your tasking and figured out how to automate or accomplish more with less toil. This is what we refer to when we say ?渁bstract?? If you can?檛 possibly build the tower of Alexandria with a hammer and chisel, learn how to use a backhoe and crane instead.

At what point while the boat is sinking with hundreds of holes do we decide to stop shoveling buckets full of water and begin to patch the holes? What is the root of your toil, the main timesink? How can we eliminate this timesink and bottleneck?

Instead of manually building your boxes, from undocumented, human-touched inconsistent work, you need to put down your proverbial hammer and chisel and learn to use the backhoe and crane. This is what we use modern ?淒evOps??tooling and methodologies for.

##I?檒l automate myself out of a job.
Stop it! Stop thinking like this. It?檚 shortsighted. The demand for engineers is constantly growing. This goes back to the equilibrium: if you aren?檛 getting ahead of work, how could you possibly automate yourself out of a job? Automation simply enables you to accomplish more, and if you are a good engineer who teaches others how to work more efficiently, you will become invaluable and indispensable to your company. Want to stop working on shitty service calls and helpdesk tickets about the same crap over and over? Abstract, reduce complexity, automate, and enable yourself and others to work on harder problems instead of doing the same shit over and over. You already identified that your workload isn?檛 getting lighter. So get ahead of it. There is always a person who needs to maintain the automation and robots. Be that person.

##This doesn?檛 apply to me/We?檙e doing fine/I don?檛 have funding to do any of this
Majority of the tools and education needed to do all of this is free, open source, or openly available on the internet in the form of website tutorials and videos.

A lot of time, your business will treat IT as a cost center. That?檚 fine. The difference between a technician and engineer is that a technician will wait to be told what to do, and an engineer identifies a problem and builds a solution. Figure out what your IT division is suffering from the most and brainstorm how you can tackle that problem with automation and standardization. Stop being satisfied with being second rate. Have pride in your work and always challenge the status quo. Again, the tools are free, the knowledge is free, you just need to put down the hammer and get your ass in the crane.

Your company may have been trying to grow for a long time, and perhaps a blocker for you is not enough personnel. Try to solve your issues from a non-linear standpoint. Throwing more bodies at a problem won?檛 solve the root issue. Be an engineer, not a technician.

EDITS:

A lot of people have asked where to start. I have thought about my entry into automation/DevOps and what would have helped me out the most:

- Deploy GitLab

A whole other discussion is what tools to learn, what to build, how to build it. Lots of seasoned orgs leverage atlassian products (bamboo, bitbucket, confluence, jira (jira is a popular one). There are currently three large ""DevOps as a Service"" platforms(don't ever coin this term, for the love of god, please). GitLab CE/EE, Microsoft's Azure DevOps, and Amazon's Code* PaaS (CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, etc.).

Why GitLab? It's free. Like, really free. Install it in EE mode without a license and it runs in CE mode, and you get almost all the features you'd need to build out a full infra automation backbone for any enterprise. It's also becoming a defacto standard in all net-new enterprise deployments I've personally seen and consulted on. Learn it, love it.

With GitLab, you're going to have a gateway drug into what most people fuck up with DevOps: Continuous Integration. Tired of spinning up a VM, running some code, then doing a snapshot rollback? Cool. Have a gitlab runner in your stack do it for you on each push, and tell you if something failed automatically. You don't need to install Jenkins and run into server sprawl. Gitlab can do it all for you.

Having an SCM platform in your network and learning to **live out of it** is one of the biggest hurdles I see. Do that early, and you'll make your life easy.

- Learn Ansible/Chef/Saltstack

Learn a config management tool. Someone commented down below that ""Scripting is fine, at some point microsoft is going to write the scripts for you"" guess what? That's what a config management tool is. It's a collection of already tested and modular scripts that you simply pass variables into (called modules). For linux, learn python. Windows? Powershell. These are the languages these modules are written in. Welcome to idempotent infra as code 101. When we say ""declarative"", we mean you really only need to write down what you want, and have someone's script go make that happen for you. Powershell DSC was MSFT's attempt at this but unless you want to deal with dependency management hell, i'd recommend a better tool like the above. I didn't mention Puppet because it's simply old, the infra is annoying to manage, the Ruby DSL is dated in comparison to newer tools that have learned from it. Thank you Puppet for paving the way, but there's better stuff out there. Chef is also getting long in the tooth, but hey, it's still good. YMMV, don't let my recommendations stop you from exploring. They all have their merits.

Do something simple, and achievable. Think patching. Write a super simple playbook that makes your boxes seek out patches, or get a windows toast notification sent to someone's desktop. https://devdocs.io/ansible~2.7/modules/win_toast_module 

**version control all the things.**

From here, you can start to brainstorm what you want to do with SCM and a config tool. Start looking into a package repository, since big binaries like program installers, tarballs, etc don't belong in source control. Put it in Artifactory or Nexus. Go from there.

P.S. If you're looking at Ansible, and you work on windows, go to your windows features and enable *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL). Then after that's enabled and rebooted, go to the microsoft app store and install Ubuntu 16 or 18, and follow the ansible install guides from there. Microsoft is investing in WSL, soon to release WSL2 (with a native linux kernel) because of the growing need for tools like these, and the ability to rapidly to develop on docker, or even docker-in-docker in some cases.

Microsoft announced a new small language model called Phi Silica. It has 3.3 billion parameters, which makes it the smallest model in Microsoft's Phi family of models. Phi Silica is designed specifically for the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) in Microsoft's new Copilot+ PCs. Despite its small size, Phi Silica can generate 650 tokens per second using only 1.5 Watts of power. This allows the PC's main processors to be free for other tasks.聽聽聽

Developers can access Phi Silica through the Windows App SDK and other AI-powered features like OCR, Studio Effects, Live Captions, and Recall User Activity APIs. Microsoft plans to release additional APIs, including Vector Embedding, RAG API, and Text Summarization. These AI-powered PCs will have dedicated AI chips for running LLMs and other AI workloads.聽

***Why does it matter?***

As Microsoft continues to invest in developing small language models and integrating AI into its Windows platform, Phi Silica represents a significant step forward in making advanced AI capabilities more accessible to developers and end-users. Also, as major PC manufacturers want to introduce AI-powered laptops this summer, Microsoft might lead the way by introducing CoPilot PC+ and now Phi Silica.聽

How is AI is reshaping the job market in cloud computing? Here's my take...,"I've been mulling over a topic that seems to be increasingly on the minds of many in our field: how AI is reshaping the job market in cloud computing. AI's evolution in areas like machine learning, data analytics, and now generative AI, is prfounldy changing the cloud computing landscape. And it's not just about automating routine tasks as a side help anymore. AI is now pivotal in strategic decision-making processes, real-time data analysis, and even in crafting new cloud solutions.

This transformation is great for businesses, especially when we consider cloud infrastructures like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. AI is optimizing these platforms in ways we hadn't imagined just a few years ago, leading to better efficiencies, enhanced scalability, and agility in data handling and processing. 

It's enabling businesses to deploy smarter, AI-driven cloud strategies, which are naturally helping stay competitive. And customers are increasingly accepting AI too depite some initial skepticism, with 65% of consumers say they?檒l trust businesses who use AI as per Forbes. When it comes to jobs, AI can create new opportunities like-

&#x200B;

1. AI Cloud Solution Architects
2. Machine Learning Engineers
3. AI Security Specialists
4. AI Cloud Service Developers
5. Data Scientists and Analysts
6. AI Ethics and Compliance Officers
7. Cloud AI User Experience Designers
8. AI-Cloud Integration Specialists

\--------------------------

However, the flip side is possibly the impact on jobs. The automation and strategic capabilities of AI, particularly in areas like cloud security, predictive maintenance, and resource optimization, raise serious questions about the future of certain roles in the cloud computing domain. As AI becomes more integral to cloud services, there could be increasing redundancy of roles that were once considered indispensable. Some jobs that I see in danger are-

&#x200B;

1. Cloud Support Services
2. Traditional Data Center Maintenance Roles
3. Basic System Administration
4. Manual Data Analysis Jobs
5. Network Monitoring and Management
6. Security Monitoring

There are lots of statistics flying around here, with many predicting millions of jobs lost while others say AI will open up new and more lucrative job roles that will exceed the loss. However, from my experience, interacting with various industries, it's clear that the impact isn't uniform. Different sectors are feeling the effects in different ways, and it's hard to pin down a universal trend. So, I'd like to ask you- What's your take on this? In your experience with cloud computing, have you noticed a shift in the job market because of AI integration?",4,7,1706379677,
Anyone else feeling like the younger generations underestimate the danger of AI?,"My Millennial/Z coworkers seem sunnily optimistic about artificial intelligence and they appear to trust management?檚 claims that it will be used only as a job aid that enhances productivity, not a means to reduce headcount eventually (even though that is typically the goal underlying productivity initiatives). They also feel that by embracing AI tools, they?檒l improve their own position in the labor market (they may be right about that one in the _short_ term??. 

On the other hand, I?檝e been in the workforce long enough to see multiple employers sacrifice quality and worker well-being on the altar of profit. I?檝e been laid off by places that didn?檛 see the point of going beyond ?渁dequate,??and I?檝e maneuvered to escape from workplaces that brought in automated tools with the obvious intention of reducing headcount because the tools??output was ?済ood enough.??Often, leaders can?檛 tell the difference between good human output and marginal automated output.

I hope my colleagues are right ??and they are smart people, I?檓 just feeling like they haven?檛 been in the trenches as long as we have. 

At my age I?檓 acutely aware that avoiding poverty in my old age will require remaining viable on the knowledge-worker job market for another 10 years at a bare minimum, preferably 15 (and I?檓 pushing 55??yep, I did not make great financial choices over the last few decades).

No one values marketing anymore even when I over deliver,"The job markets awful, so I took a contract way below my normal rate to as a ""prove it"" contract for a startup with the promise of equity and better pay if I helped them launch their product and raise capital.

In 4 weeks I built out their entire analytics system (they were flying blind), I redid all of their positioning and messaging, conversion optimized their website and user onboarding process (they didn't even have an easy way to contact them, no demo video, typos in their welcome e-mail - had to help them setup an actual sequence as well, no testimonials or social proof before me), helped implement a qualification process for sales - they were just taking every meeting request before me, got them launched on G2 and Sourceforge, did a ProductHunt and helped them rank #3 for the day they launched, in 3 weeks got over 7,000+ signups to the platform, over 40k visitors to the website, took their demo video viral on X, tripled social media followers, over 300+ meeting requests, 53 meetings booked with qualified high value potential customers potentially worth millions in future revenue. 

Oh, and setup AI analytics to unmask their direct traffic, helped them build out an automation workflow to cold e-mail the people who were visiting the website the most without signing up, and setup Google ads, X ads, and Reddit ads and was driving considerable top of funnel traffic with a stupidly small budget. Had to create the creatives myself as well without any help or contractors.

My thanks? They canceled the contract after the 4 week trial. Told me they under estimated how much work it would take to manage all these new users I just brought them, and they needed the budget they were paying me for hiring support people and devrel because now they had too many users. Ironically I have experience with devrel but they didn't want me to do it for some reason and hired some part-time person in Brazil. They were paying me about 1/3 my normal rate. I didn't even get a chance to use the full ad budget I was supposed to be getting.

I can't help but feel used and abused at this point. Most marketing teams would have taken 3-6 months to achieve what I achieved in 4 weeks alone with no resources or budget.

These guys now have everything they need to go close a series A, and I barely got paid enough to even cover my rent for a month. Obviously, it was on me for taking a risk, I know that, but the sting doesn't hurt any less. I built them a marketing foundation, and they're now mostly going to turn everything off or put it on autopilot with no one who knows how to fly the plane.

Nearly 20 years in marketing, and no matter how well I perform it just doesn't seem to matter anymore. I always lose the contract or the job at this point, and it's been like this since the pandemic started and seems to only be getting worse.

Please tell me there's still hope for marketing as a career? Are y'all seeing similar situations right now? Wtf is going on with this market? Why are founders so out of touch?",279,360,1712880218,
The best AI tools for everyday use and productivity (that are actually free to use),"I've spent an ungodly amount of time ~~procrastinating~~ trying tons of new/free AI tools from Reddit and various lists of the best AI tools for different use cases. Frankly, most free AI tools (and even paid ones) are gimmicky ChatGPT wrappers with questionable utility in everyday tasks or overpriced enterprise software that don't use AI as anything more than a marketing buzzword.

My last list of free AI tools got a good response, and I wanted to make another with the best AI tools that I actually use day-to-day now that I've spent more time with them. 

All these tools can be used for free, though most of them have some kind of premium offering if you need more advanced stuff or a ton of queries. To make it easy to sort through, I've also added whether each tool requires signup. 

## [ChatPDF](https://chatpdf.com/): Free Tool to Use ChatGPT on Your Own Documents/PDFs

*(free no signup)*

Put simply, ChatPDF lets you upload any PDF and interact with it like ChatGPT. I heard about this one from my nephew who used it to automatically generate flashcards and explain concepts based on class notes and readings. There are a few similar services out there, but I found ChatPDF the easiest to use of those that don't require payment/signup.

If you're a student or someone who needs to read through long PDFs regularly, the possibilities to use this are endless. It's also completely free and doesn't require signup. 

**Key Features:**

* Free to upload **up to 3 PDFs daily, with up to 120 pages in each PDF**
* **Can be used without signing up at all**

## [Taskade](https://taskade.com/): AI Task Management, Scheduling, and Notetaking Tool with GPT-4 Built-In

*(free with signup)*

Taskade is an all-in-one notetaking, task management, and scheduling platform with built-in AI workflows and templates. Like Notion, Taskade lets you easily create workspaces, documents, and templates for your workflows. Unlike Notion?檚 GPT-3 based AI, Taskade has built-in GPT-4 based AI that?檚 trained to structure your documents, create content, and otherwise help you improve your productivity.

**Key Features:**

* **GPT-4 is built in to their free plan** and trained to help with document formatting, scheduling, content creation and answering questions through a chat interface. Its AI seems specifically trained to work seamlessly with your documents and workspaces, and understands queries specific to their interface like asking it to turn (text) notes into a mind map.
* **One of the highest usage limits of the free tools**: Taskade?檚 free plan comes with 1000 monthly requests, which is one of the highest I?檝e seen for a tool with built-in GPT-4. Because it?檚 built into a document editor with database, scheduling and chat capabilities, you can use it for pretty much anything you?檇 use ChatGPT for but *without* paying for ChatGPT Premium.
* **Free templates to get you started with actually integrating AI into your workflows:** there are a huge number of genuinely useful free templates for workflows, task management, mind mapping, etc. For example, you can add a project and have Taskade automatically map out and schedule a breakdown of the tasks that make up that overall deliverable.

## [Plus AI](https://plusdocs.com/) for Google Slides: AI-generated (and improved) slide decks

*(free with signup, addon for Google Slides)*

I've tried out a bunch of AI presentation/slide generating tools. To be honest, most of them leave a lot to be desired and aren't genuinely useful unless you're literally paid to generate a presentation vaguely related to some topic. Plus AI is a (free!) Google Slides addon that lets you describe the kind of slide deck you're making, then generate and fine-tune it based on your exact needs.

It's still not at the point where you can literally just tell it one prompt and get the entire finished product, but it saves a bunch of time getting an initial structure together that you can then perfect. Similarly, if you have existing slides made you can tell it (in natural language) how you want it changed. For example, asking it to change up the layout of text on a page, improve the writing style, or even use external data sources.

**Key Features:**

* **Integrates seamlessly into Google Slides:** if you?檙e already using Slides, using Plus AI is as simple as installing the plugin. Their tutorials are easy to follow and it doesn?檛 require learning some new slideshow software or interface like some other options.
* **Create** ***and*** **tweak slides using natural language**: Plus AI lets you create whole slideshows, adjust text, or change layouts using natural language. It?檚 all fairly intuitive and the best of the AI slide tools I?檝e tried.

## [FlowGPT](https://flowgpt.com/): Database of AI prompts and workflows

*(free without signup-though it pushes you to signup!)*

FlowGPT collects prompts and collections of prompts to do various tasks, from marketing, productivity, and coding to random stuff people find interesting. It uses an upvote system similar to Reddit that makes it easy to find interesting ways to use ChatGPT. It also lets you search for prompts if you have something in mind and want to see what others have done.

It's free and has a lot of cool features like showing you previews of how ChatGPT responds to the prompts. Unfortunately, it's also a bit pushy with getting you to signup, and the design leaves something to be desired, but it's the best of these tools I've found.

**Key Features:**

* Lots of users that share genuinely useful and interesting prompts
* Upvote system similar to Reddit?檚 that allows you to find interesting prompts within the categories you?檙e interested in

## [Summarize.Tech](http://summarize.tech/): AI summaries of YouTube Videos

*(free no signup)*

Summarize generates AI summaries of YouTube videos, condensing them into relatively short written notes with timestamps. All the summaries I've seen have been accurate and save significant time.

I find it especially useful when looking at longer tutorials where I want to find if:

&#x200B;

1. The tutorial actually tells me what I'm looking for, and
2. See where in the video I can find that specific part. The one downside I've seen is that it doesn't work for videos that don't have subtitles, but hopefully, someone can build something with Whisper or a similar audio transcription API to solve that.

## [Claude](https://claude.ai/): ChatGPT Alternative with ~75k Word Limit

*(free with signup)*

If you've used ChatGPT, you've probably run into the issue of its (relatively low) token limit. Put simply, it can't handle text longer than a few thousand words. It's the same reason why ChatGPT ""forgets"" instructions you gave it earlier on in a conversation. Claude solves that, with a \~75,000 word limit that lets you input literal novels and do pretty much everything you can do with ChatGPT.

*Unfortunately,* Claude is currently only free in the US or UK. Claude pitches itself as the ""safer"" AI, which can make it a pain to use for many use cases, but it's worth trying out and better than ChatGPT for certain tasks. Currently, I'm mainly using it to summarize long documents that ChatGPT literally cannot process as a single prompt.

**Key Features:**

* **Much longer word limit than even ChatGPT?檚 highest token models**
* **Stronger guardrails than ChatGPT:** if you're into this, Claude focuses a lot more on ""trust and safety"" than even ChatGPT does. While an AI telling me what information I can and can't have is more of an annoyance for my use cases, it can be useful if you're building apps like customer support or other use cases where it's a top priority to keep the AI from writing something ""surprising."" 

## [Phind](https://www.phind.com/): AI Search Engine That Combines Google with ChatGPT

*(free no signup)*

Like a combination of Google and ChatGPT. Like ChatGPT, it can understand complex prompts and give you detailed answers condensing multiple sources. Like Google, it shows you the most up-to-date sources answering your question and has access to everything on the internet in real time (vs. ChatGPT's September 2021 cutoff).

*Unlike* Google, it avoids spammy links that seem to dominate Google nowadays and actually answers your question.

**Key Features:**

* **Accesses the internet to get you real-time information vs. ChatGPT?檚 2021 cutoff.** While ChatGPT is great for content generation and other tasks that you don?檛 really need live information for, it can?檛 get you any information from past its cutoff point.
* **Provides actual sources for its claims, helping you dive deeper into any specific points and avoid hallucinations.** Phind was the first to combine the best of both worlds between Google and ChatGPT, giving you easy access to actual sources the way Google does while summarizing relevant results the way ChatGPT does. It?檚 still one of the best places for that, especially if you have technical questions.

## [Bing AI](https://bing.com/?/ai): ChatGPT Alternative Based on GPT-4 (with internet access!)

*(free no signup)*

For all the hate Bing gets, they've done the best job of all the major search engines of integrating AI chat to answer questions. Bing's Chat AI is *very* similar to ChatGPT (it's based on GPT-4).

Unlike ChatGPT's base model without plugins, it has access to the internet. It also doesn't require signing in, which is nice.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Google has really dropped the ball lately in delivering non-spammy search results that actually answer the query, and it's nice to see other search engines like Bing and Phind providing alternatives.

**Key Features:**

* Similar to Phind, though arguably a bit better for non-technical questions: Bing similarly provides sourced summaries, generates content and otherwise integrates AI and search nicely.
* **Built on top of GPT-4:** like Taskade, Bing has confirmed they use GPT-4. That makes it another nice option to get around paying for GPT-4 while still getting much of the same capabilities as ChatGPT.
* **Seamless integration with a standard search engine** that?檚 much better than I remember it being (when it was more of a joke than anything)

## Honorable Mentions:

These are the ?渞est of the best??free AI tools I've found that are simpler/don't need a whole entry to explain:

* [**PdfGPT**](https://pdfgpt.com/): Alternative to ChatPDF that also uses AI to summarize and let you interact with PDF documents. Nice to have options if you run into one site?檚 PDF or page limit and don?檛 want to pay to do so.
* [**Remove.bg**](http://remove.bg/): One of the few image AI tools I use regularly. [Remove.bg](http://remove.bg/) uses simple AI to remove backgrounds from your images. It's very simple, but something I end up doing surprisingly often editing product images, etc.
* **CopyAI and Jasper**: both are AI writing tools primarily built for website marketing/blog content. I've tried both but don't use them enough regularly to be able to recommend one over the other. Worth trying if you do a lot of content writing and want to automate parts of it.

Let me know if you guys recommend any other free AI tools that you use day-to-day and I can add them to the list. 

I?檓 also interested in any requests you guys have for AI tools that don?檛 exist yet, as I?檓 looking for new projects to work on at the moment!

# TL;DR:

[**ChatPDF**](https://chatpdf.com)**:** Interact with any PDF using ChatGPT without signing up, great for students and anyone who needs to filter through long PDFs.

[**Taskade**](https://taskade.com)**:** All-in-one task management, scheduling, and notetaking with built-in GPT-4 Chat + AI assistant for improving productivity.

"How To Start An AI Agency - Get Off The Grift Train And Stop Watching Youtubers Who Allegedly Earn 70,000 A Month","Alright so who the hell am I to dish out advice on this? Well I am no one really, but I am an AI Engineer and, amongst other things, I run my own AI Agency, im not posting links unless you ask in the comments, because I am doing my best not to be spammy. Im not posting this here looking for work or attention, im doing this because the Youtuber grift is REAL, consuming tens of videos a day on how you can make $70,000 a month is BS right now.

In this post im going tell you what ITS REALLY LIKE starting an AI agency from scratch with NO MONEY. And I am going to tell you how you really go about making money and getting customers.

THIS IS A GRIFT

There are a handful of youtubers in this fledgling AI Agents industry of ours that bang on constantly about how much money you can make, their long videos with whiteboards and even their own acronyms and all they do is funnel you in to their training academy's where you pay basically for more of of this content. This is damaging because at first site you watch some of these videos, you may have built some basic agents and your brain is going ""Holly shit I can earn $25,000 a week sitting at my desk!??!!?!"". Its BS. They are making the vast majority of their money teaching you how to run an automation agency rather than teaching you how to be an AI engineer who can turn those skills in to $$$.

OK, SO HOW DO YOU START?

Alright well first of all you don't really need anything other than a laptop and a small amount of money for API costs. You dont need a website or even a business name to start. What you need to do first is validate that you can actually do this.

STEP 1

Learn about AI agents, how they work, how to build them etc. Build some projects for yourself or your mum.

STEP 2

Once you have built some agents or automations start telling everyone, in fact tell anyone who will listen, offer to the build personal assistants (GPTs) for people, basic agents, basic automations and get some feedback.

STEP 3

Approach some friends or friends of friends who have a business and offer to build some agents and automations for free and use their API keys - so its not costing you anything other than time.

At this point leverage templates where you can to save time.

Really try to solve a genuine business problem and do it for free in return for a favourable written testimonial from the business.

THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I STARTED!

IF you can find a niche that you understand then even better. For me I have a distant real estate background. I know a family member who currently works in real estate so I offered to automate some of her work for free, I also built her a series of GPT assistants for various things. SHE LOVED IT and told everyone about it. From there I got a few more people in her company and another company and then once I had built a few automations and agents for several real estate people I had some testimonials.

What I had done is VALIDATED my idea, Ive proved I can do it (I knew that bit anyway because I am already an AI Engineer) and now I have some testimonials from real customers.

STEP 4

Start making $70,000 a month!!! Not yeh hold on... Now you gotta put the hard work in... Yeh because guess what? Like running any other small business this is F'ing hard work. Don't expect to put your OPEN sign up and be flooded with customers desperate to give you cash. It isn't like that.

Step 4 is get yourself a business name and a website. Don't over think so step. Just a basic well presented site, use a template to speed things up and get it online. This should take you know more than a week to choose a name and get a website up and running. Make sure that those testimonials are prominent on the site and maybe add a blog section where you can post all your projects.

Step 5

Ok now you are legit. Sit back and just bank that cash baby! Yeh ok im still joking. You gotta a lot of work to do now. Start by contacting other companies in the area in the same industry sector who could benefit from your previous work. For me this was other real estate companies. Start with smaller companies because the decision to use AI can be made quickly. Work you way through them and make sure you use testimonials in any out reach.

For example:

""I built this AI agent for X and Co, it saved them 500 hours per year - I can do the same for you""

Do not over think this stage, keep the marketing to the point.

Step 6  
Grow to $70,000 per month! This final step is just about growing. From this point you hopefully will have some paying customers and some great testimonials and you can start advertising. But seriously put the 70k a month thing out of your head - you MIGHT get to that point, and I hope you will. But stay realistic and you gotta work hard.

This new world of AI and agents might blow our minds - but the fact is MOST people are still quite sceptical about AI. Even if you can save X and Co $50,000 a year by automating their emails, they still might say no because they are worried about AI taking everyones jobs in a month!

Start small, take your time, work hard and MAYBE one day you can be just like those grifters on Youtube and tell everyone who will listen that you make $70,000 a month sat in your pajamas with a laptop.

Good luck to you all.",268,92,1740822153,
How do advancements in artificial intelligence impact the job market and future employment?,"Haaah?? man, this AI thing is really shaking things up in the job market these days, huh? It seems like it's automating so many roles that used to be done by people. Anything repetitive or involving basic data entry, processing, or customer service calls - machines can handle that stuff now better and cheaper than humans.  
Entire industries are feeling the pinch, too. Self-driving vehicles are going to be a game changer for transportation jobs. And can you imagine how many administrative assistants might be replaced by AI assistants that can book meetings, take notes, manage calendars and more? Crazy, don't you think?  
But it's not all doom and gloom. AI is also creating new kinds of jobs we've never seen before. Programmers and engineers who know how to develop AI technologies are in high demand. Companies also need data scientists to help machines learn and ethicists to make sure AI stays on the right side.  
For many jobs, the tasks may change but the work won't disappear completely. People will still be needed, just in different roles where they use their human skills. Creativity, problem-solving, managing others - those things machines can't replicate.  
Overall it's a big transition. AI will keep reshaping what jobs look like, but as long as we prepare people with the right skills, I think humans and machines can coexist and even help each other out in the workplace. Exciting times ahead!",2,2,1706180917,
I am a self-proclaimed ?淎I Expert?? You should be very afraid.,"*[This article was originally published on Medium.](https://medium.com/r/0eb739361851)*

[Pic: ""An army of AI robots taking over the world"" ??X's Grok](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*GpQiNqKX5iJD0xYFgOoMlA.jpeg)

How do you define an ""AI Expert""?

**Is it someone that is capable of building these AI models from scratch? Trying novel algorithms and writing a paper on their results?**

Is it someone who's built functional applications utilizing AI? Someone that has won competitions, like hackathons, against other engineers trying to achieve the same goal?

Perhaps it's someone went to school for it. Took classes in artificial intelligence and deep learning, and understood how these algorithms work under the hood.

I am all of the above. I've built comprehensive AI applications from scratch, [many of which are open-source on my GitHub](https://github.com/austin-starks/).

I've won not one, but two different AI-themed hackathons. This includes leading cross-functional groups of engineers, data scientists, nurses, and other designers to build a solution from scratch, which beat every other project that was presented.

And I went to Carnegie Mellon University, the best AI school in the entire world, according to [US News and World Report](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2024/september/us-news-and-world-report-ranks-carnegie-mellon-university-no-1-in-5-categories-21st-among-national).

And I'm here to tell you that you should be VERY afraid of AI??
**If you are lazy and not that great at what you do.**

# Doers vs. Do Nothings: The Unspoken Divide

**There is an unspoken divide between the people that have agency and build things, and the people that sit idly by and do the bare minimum**.

And AI will transform this chasm into a canyon.

[Pic: ""AI creating a giant divide between the Do-ers and the Do-Nothings"" ??X's Grok](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*f719YWFTBPmIcGi-qT2c8Q.jpeg)

Why is this? It's very simple.

Artificial intelligence lowers the threshold of ""what can I build"" by a lot.

Thanks to artificial intelligence, the people that have never written a line of code before can create robust, full-stacked web applications entirely from scratch.

And the people that code a lot turn into absolute monsters.

**But lowering this threshold does absolutely nothing for the people that stay at home all day, scrolling through TikTok, and watching life past them by.** The only people that can take advantage of this are the people that wake up thinking about something they want to build.

And the amount of benefits this group will reap is absolutely insane.

Don't believe me? Here is an example.

# Before and After AI: The Evolution of a Project

Before the invention of ChatGPT, I started building a no-code automated investing platform, [NextTrade](https://github.com/austin-starks/NextTrade).

NextTrade makes it easy for non-technical investors to create, test, optimize, and deploy algorithmic trading strategies. Within two years I built a platform that could:
- **Allow semi-technical people to create their own automated trading rules**
- **Allow traders to backtest their rule and paper-trade them**
- Enable them to deploy their strategies to the market for real-time paper-trading

I worked on this everyday, multiple times per day. I wrote complex algorithms in React that would make even a professional programmer squirm at my intricate usage of breadth-first search. This includes a genetic optimization algorithm for finance, something entirely novel and not available for any other open source trading platform out there.

[Pic: The NextTrade UI. Notice the hardcoded notification icon in the top right. This picture shows a ""genetic optimization"" of trading strategies](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*n6Ynt9Jmdq7LU6wxDJ_TXg.png)

And writing all of this code took years because I had to write every single line by myself. Even in the end result, you can see places that aren't finished, like hardcoded watchlists, and lack of cryptocurrency support.

But eventually, I gave up on NextTrade. It had inherent issues with speed and configurability, and needed a complete architectural overhaul. I open-sourced it, took a break, and eventually sought to build NextTrade V2 (now called [NexusTrade](https://nexustrade.io/)).

Only this time, I had AI to help me.

**The Artificial (Intelligence) Speed Force Boost**

When rebuilding NexusTrade, I had the blessing of the AI speed gods on my side. Its power turned me into a lean-mean software engineering machine.

In the same amount of time that I rebuilt NextTrade, I was able to build the following with NexusTrade:
- Rebuilt the entire backend in Rust, a language that I previously had zero experience with, and re-implemented the backtesting, paper-trading, strategy optimization, and live deployment features
- Made the platform entirely no-code and highly configurable by introducing ""indicators"", including technical and fundamental indicators
- Integrated with Alpaca to allow the deployment of real trading strategies to the market
- Implemented cryptocurrency support
- Added dynamic watchlists, which users can use to receive daily emails about their favorite stocks
- Added in-app tutorials that allowed users
- Created an email marketing system that sends customized emails to my users
- Created a NexusTrade Blog, that allows for likes and comments of posts
- Built a fully-functional, AI chat that can create trading strategies, perform financial analysis, and find novel investment strategies

[Pic: The AI chat interface in NexusTrade. Users can use it to create strategies, test them, and perform advanced financial research](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*fGlAmUMMxtNmstwcaEnxmg.png)

And yes, there's even more.

All of this was made possible thanks to large language models. It didn't just amplify my skills, it allowed me to create new ones.

With NextTrade V1, I was just a software engineer. But with NexusTrade V2, I became a marketing expert, a salesman, an operations officer, a customer support agent, and the chief executive.

And I didn't learn these skills in a classroom. I learned them from sitting down and doing them.

Because of AI's empowerment, I've built a platform that's enjoyed by over 16,000 people. None of this would be possible without AI.

[Pic: User growth for NexusTrade over time](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kNR1UuGk2jq6L_J7eZGkkw.png)

And, this was made possible because of my attitude as a builder. I was a Doer even without AI; AI just made me 20x more productive by allowing me to accomplish real tasks in a fraction of the time.

And this trend is not going to stop. In fact, I dare argue that it will be even more amplified in the near future.

# Concluding Thoughts

**There's an old saying that ""AI isn't going to take your job; people using AI will take your job.""**

I want to take that a step further.

The people that are the ""Doers"", that work hard, that are highly motivated and fiercely disciplined will take the jobs of the lazy and the unskilled.

If this scares you, you should do something about it.

Learn to be valuable. Because of AI, anybody can start right now. Learn about social media marketing, and what makes a video go viral. Build a web app from scratch for your clothing store. Pick up a hammer and build a birdhouse for your nieces and nephews. Become a builder.

Because AI isn't coming for everybody's job. But it will create a divide between those who embrace it and those who ignore it. The question isn't whether AI will change the world ??it's whether you'll be ready to adapt and thrive in the world it creates.

Which one are you?",188,125,1737985866,
"Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, another generational bull market has begun - The ultimate silver DD. $PSLV $SILJ","I?檝e already posted DDs on silver in WallStreetBets a couple times, but I decided to come to r/StockMarket this time because WSB is completely focused on GME at the moment. 

Note this is not a post to tell you sell your GME. I?檓 personally still long GME.

In fact I hope I GME hits $1000 after earnings, I salute you fellow Apes.

&#x200B;

Silver however, is the market I have done the most research for, and why I am writing this DD. 

This post is quite long so here?檚 the **TLDR if you are lazy:** Buy PSLV and get ready to ride the silver rocketship. Alternatively, purchase 1000oz bars of silver at premiums under 5% to ride the rocket.

Quick Bullets:

* Silver will rise dramatically due to a fundamentals-based rally in industrial and monetary demand
* A short squeeze in silver is on the precipice of occurring, and could add gasoline to a bonfire, current short interest is 513%
* SLV is a scam, if you own it then sell and purchase PSLV (and the same goes for GLD, you can buy PHYS instead)
* The banks that run the silver market have been labeled ?榗riminal enterprises??by the DOJ, for metals price manipulation, and these are the same banks entrusted with SLV/SIVR

&#x200B;

There are two types of bull markets in silver.  One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand.  The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze.  Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets. 

**I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.** 

So what are these ?榮moke alarms??I mentioned? 

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle. 

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ?榮moke??  

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP.  More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/5yh58ntwguo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da878286af614bfa216734371b1b9c257726612

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply. 

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at.  Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ?榲aluation??level of silver.  

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ?榮moke alarm??that is the signal to start buying.  In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.  

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP). 

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.  

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.  

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high).  Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater).  Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested.  Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation).  This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011.  Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ?榣ost decade??for equities.  The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period.  Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation).  There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market. 

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples.  And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms.  Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse.  Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities. 

https://preview.redd.it/77j9noo9huo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c794b8d8b8e339ebeac5757add7cf7492a8949a

I in no way think this is coming to the United States.  I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse.  Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn?檛 necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade. 

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91.  Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade?檚 massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs).  Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021.  Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver?檚 SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.  

&#x200B;

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver.  Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations.  (LN scale because silver is nature?檚 money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out.  And there?檚 really no reason it must stop there.**  

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement MMT related policies with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue.  This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring.  Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more).  The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended.  What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices. 

&#x200B;

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates.  And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

 

https://preview.redd.it/dyp2056qhuo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa926d50b73015ff6106b64c546d79c60369ec6

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant.  They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed.  As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don?檛 see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it?檚 rumored the upcoming ?榠nfrastructure??bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in.  Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation?檚 debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high.  So they won?檛 raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself.  They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high).  So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can?檛 raise rates at a time of expanding inflation?  The value of the dollar.  We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform). 

The other problem with the fed?檚 policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment.  In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies.  Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation. 

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job.  The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years.  At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years. 

&#x200B;

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now.  This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too.  Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well.  There?檚 also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well.  Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting.  The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates. 

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don?檛 need 2 accounting departments after all).  How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable.  Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well. 

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors).  **The fed?檚 solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they?檒l keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.**  And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need?  And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It?檚 a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver. 

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input?  Silver. Silver?檚 industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable.  So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further. 

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It?檚 also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lh1uc7shuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7173278d6cf25987cf42ca93fd64caeed499c2

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don?檛 worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn?檛 much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren?檛 going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon.  The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation. 

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren?檛 necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer.  I can guarantee most people don?檛 even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any.  The move back into having even a small precious metals allocation it is what drives silver up by 30x or more. 

&#x200B;

Now it is time to dive deeper into the other contributor to the silver bull market, **the short squeeze.**  

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ?榞reen??commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver. 

Lets dig into the silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself. 

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity.  So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ?榬oll??them over to a future date.  Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn?檛 exist, then the market wouldn?檛 be a true market for silver.  Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality. 

&#x200B;

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don?檛 typically do it through the futures market.  They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass.  They only do it if they really have to.  Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery.  Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market. 

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver.  The COMEX has an inventory of ?榬egistered??silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight.  But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers. 

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently? 

Let?檚 take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/3o4eda0zhuo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5212d0ec99fa8fadc3e87d7d97da0327f9bd9a06

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered.  This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find. 

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis. 

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is. 

https://preview.redd.it/y0zbsru0iuo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5619336c219421bc93c10be859dd581814fdb7

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic.  While silver doesn?檛 need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze.  The 2001-2011 rally didn?檛 involve a short squeeze for example, so it ?榦nly??caused silver to rise 10x.  In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.  

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0wd4lwgqkuo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf26d8204bc0817457ebe56a6354ba7ede4ad8e

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ?榚ligible??category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered.  It is called ?榚ligible??because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven?檛 taken it out of the warehouse.  It is technically eligible become ?榬egistered??if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell. 

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort.  And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American.  If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX.  That?檚 how tight this market is. 

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check.  If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher. 

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract?檚 open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/knr5kwz7iuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07edc45ea6d245cb58ff972cc93b847861d6c6e

It looks almost unreal.  And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves.  That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/pf93niaaiuo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4835e10de33e28790f7c588858c883df25f44949

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year?檚 February totals by a multiple of 4x.  Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.  

April?檚 open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces.  20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.   

Here?檚 what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/9qehkardiuo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeeaccab17039c03f9b8214dabfce7dea377ea18

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)?  Well let?檚 look at the next active delivery month of May:

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lgflbrhiuo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84d4fe485a9a5a0cafeb7e6d8a40f99a88049a0

https://preview.redd.it/j3u861k0juo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee4cc550f8b790a913f7ce073ae9afe8e6f5230

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%.  Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.  

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ?榝orce majeure??and defaults on its delivery obligations.  This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won?檛 get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic.  As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.  

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough.  Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.  

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it?檚 just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders.  The GME short squeeze may indeed return, because in this situation it?檚 millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can?檛 force them to sell. 

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that?檚 exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, [they forced them to sell](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunt-brothers-trying-to-corner-silver-market-2016-5).  The difference this time is that it?檚 not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing silver.  There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there?檚 no basis to stop the squeeze.  

The regulators literally pulled a ?楪ameStop??on the silver market.  Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ?榮ilver??  The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it?檚 not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it?檚 millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each.  There is no cornering the market going on.  This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them.  They?檝e been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion.  Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors. 

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played? 

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.** ??Unless their bluff is truly called, and short squeeze occurs. Which means that the paper supply (contract silver that exists in the form of short futures contracts) has to be bought back at far higher prices to prevent further margin calls and possible insolvency. 

When the silver squeeze began in late January, there was a flurry of media interviews and articles by experts who claimed that a retail driven short squeeze just isn?檛 possible.  Why were they so confident? Because the banks have owned this game since futures began trading, and retail buyers don?檛 purchase 1000oz bars, they tend to purchase 1oz coins.

These small unit coins and bars are produced by mints both public and private.  These mints take 1000oz bars and use them to produce smaller silver bars and coins, but there is a limit to their production capacity. In normal times a mint might produce 5 million ounces a year, and in a time like today when demand is surging maybe they run the machines 24 hours a day and pump that production up to 10 million ounces in a year.  Does this add to demand for 1000oz bars? Yes, but the amount that it can add is capped at the production capacity of the mints.  Beyond the amount production can be ramped up, demand simply pushes premiums for these small units of silver higher, rather than the price of silver itself.  The large banks who are short 1000oz bars know that demand from this channel is capped, and thus they feel perfectly safe remaining in, or even increasing their short positions when retail coin and bar demand surges. 

Once small unit silver premiums soar, the next place retail investors start to place money is in silver ETFs, primarily the SLV ETF.  This is where the real fucking over of retail silver investors starts. 

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

?淚n terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.????Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault.  They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it?檚 the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX.  Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all.  So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren?檛.  The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs.  Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors.  He truly meant what he said. 

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF. 

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring.  Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows.  **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.**  When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange.  As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price.  It?檚 a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits.  Here?檚 a diagram to help you sort it out:

"AI Apocalypse: Goldman Sachs Report Reveals ChatGPT Could Devastate 300 Million Full-Time Jobs Worldwide, Including Legal and Administrative","AI, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, has seen a surge in popularity, leading to concerns about its potential impact on the labor market. New research from Goldman Sachs indicates that around 300 million full-time jobs globally could be affected by the rise of generative AI systems. The study found that about two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation, and generative AI could replace up to a quarter of current work.

White-collar workers, particularly those in the US legal and administrative sectors, are at higher risk of being affected by new AI tools. This is because the legal services industry consists of a relatively small number of occupations already susceptible to AI automation. Despite the potential disruptions, the widespread implementation of generative AI could lead to labor cost savings and the creation of new jobs, such as prompt engineers who write text to test AI chatbots.

*Daily Update: Last mini update 17Aug2021. Come back everyday to check r/amcstock?檚 new posts by filter flair/top/hot posts and this post if you?檙e looking for new important DD, I try to link up new ones every other day.*

Feel free to save and share this post to others who might find this helpful. Permanent link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/okskna/massive_amc_dd_compilation/

*Edit: OMG. ?槶 Thank you so much for all the kind words, love and support shown to this post. Although this was heavily downvoted, I?檓 still so glad it managed to reach some of you and I really appreciate all of you!! Do let me know via comments to this post if you have any feedback or suggestion to improve this into the best ever DD compilation! ?グ Let?檚 continue to welcome our new apes with this long wall of text!!* ?槅

#For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; For those who don?檛, no explanation will suffice. 

Hello ape fam?グ I'm u/asianlady_. Nice to meet you if we haven't said hi to each other. Although the original dd compilation post was old, it still got the attention of downvoting shills everyday. Since then, I've also received plenty of strange notifications, from personal attacks to death threats. Whoever they are, for whatever reasons, I strongly believe that they just simply do not want new apes to have access to the marvelous DDs made by our community. As for me, I really don't care about them and since I've also been asked before to repost the DD, here it is!

#APE RULE #1: Do Your Own DD and Make Your Own Plans!

This post is progressively updated for the new apes and apettes. It may not be perfect but it should contain some of the most important ones! Do check r/amcstock for more DD related to AMC stock, use the flair or filter by top or hot posts. In this new post, I've improvised a little to make it easier for you to navigate!

As our community is growing everyday; please be selective of the source of information, too much fake news out there! The compilation was originally created for educational purposes only but now reposted because even the words ""too much"" is an understatement; the articles we read and the TV news we viewed, many mainstream media do not report the truth and most often have been manipulated! ?敟

#APE RULE #2: NO predictions, NO dates, NO financial advice!

Remember, do not ask or give financial advice! Read r/amcstock rules before participating in this sub. We should not ask anyone to buy or sell for legal reasons but you can absolutely do what you want; such as trusting the process and HODL! ?拵?檶?徎

Also, we have many friendly and helpful OG apes and mods here, feel free to ask them questions or visit the daily livechat where they are usually most active during US trading hours. However, it would really be nice if you could do your own research first because many of them have been asked the same questions over and over again.. so this is another one reason why this compilation exists!

If anyone is breaking the rules or harassing anyone, do dm or tag [our beloved mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/about/moderators/)! ?敤

#Useful links to watch the market:

[NYSE](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:AMC) | [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc) | [US Market](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/) | [German Market](https://www.ls-tc.de/en/stock/714132) | [Fidelity](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AMC) | [Stonk-O-Tracker](https://amc.crazyawesomecompany.com/) | [Ortex](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/27270) | [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)

Do note that in general we do not have a trusted mainstream media and websites as companies with integrity are almost non-existent due to many complicated factors, politics, money, etc. If you analyze enough, we're sure you could tell there are just too much FUD and misinformation.

#Verified AMC DD Writers Who Are Active on r/amcstock!

Special thanks to all the amazing wrinkled apes on this sub, baby apes are forever thankful for your voluntary contributions!
u/Few_Campaign8623, u/AnnaSlatz, u/einfachman, u/Appropriate_Elk_3827, u/skyphoenyx, u/Feeling_Point_5978, u/Cigarsnbeer, u/Relevant-Ad-6932, u/nigolishin, u/CrsCrpr and many more!

Also, I believe there are a few passionate apes out there actively creating contents on Youtube but unfortunately I don?檛 watch any of them and I am also aware that there are a few fake apes or some ultimately being paid to create FUD so this list will be kept short as possible as I cannot vouch for most of them! If you really prefer to learn something about AMC stock or just to stay informed over Youtube, some of our apes are very fond of: TreyTrades and Matt Kohr.

Feel free to nominate users (even yourself) via comments on this post, kindly do not dm me as I don't read dms and please don't be offended if you're an active DD writer but your username is not listed here yet; this sub-reddit and reddit itself is a huge website, there are too many posts and I could only do/read so much a day. Just reply to this post, I'll try to update this list when I can.

#All AMC Investors Are The Real MVPs!

To whoever reading this, I hope you will find this useful and hope someday, somehow we will have a fair market for all! Do know that all of you are equally important, no matter where you are from or what your background is. Be kind to yourself, take care of yourself. This big ape family are all hodling for each other and APES STRONG TOGETHER!

Feel free to share this post to others as well as using any of the contents you may find here for your further research or even making a new, better post!
Remember to like r/amcstock Daily Live Chat (Daily Thread) and ALL OTHER USEFUL DDs! Keep sharing DD and motivate each other!! Great job for HODLING everyday fellow apes and apettes!! ?わ笍?わ笍

Seriously, watch them. It helps to understand the stock market and what have been going on better. More to be added in the future, feel free to recommend them. I did not list everything I know because I am not an expert and I did not manage to read/watch them as of writing due to personal commitments or pure procrastination.

AI will crash the economy sooner than you think,"The differing views on when AI will take over most jobs are interesting to read.

But what I feel is lacking is the fact that AI only needs to displace a relatively small part of the workforce to have catastrophic effects on any developed nation's economy.

Imagine a country with 5 percent unemployment rate. Now imagine AI and automation displacing only 10 percent of workers. Let's say for sake of argument administrative staff, factory-, fast food employees, taxi drivers and store clerks are the first to go.

All of the sudden unemployment is up by 200 percent - from 5 percent to 15 percent.

This leads to less demand for consumer products causing more layoffs in multiple sectors.

Many newly unemployed workers, now on a much tighter budget, will need to sell their homes - possibly causing a crash in the housing market. This will also lead to less spending  - again reinforcing the decline in consumerism.

Meanwhile government spending on welfare will need to increase as poverty takes hold in wider groups of the population - leading to higher taxes - causing more dampening of investment and consumption - further reinforcing the downward spiral.

This will all happen way before any government acts to implement UBI.

I don't see any other way this plays out.

Change my mind.",423,470,1683783252,
Not a shortage? No applicants for tax accountant job ($75K to $105K)...,"Lots of chatter about people applying to 300 postings and getting only rejections.

But for context and as a contrast, here's my experience as a small CPA firm employer: For a no-overtime job where I'm asking for a couple of years experience, I've gotten 4 applicants. Two qualified.

This job is being actively promoted by Indeed so there should be plenty of visibility. But there's the employer experience.

Even if from the applicants' side of things, it looks like there are no jobs? From my side, it looks like there are no candidates...

PS I went through 100 resumes in the Indeed resume bank. And a few I'll reach out to. But the number of people who actually have a couple of years expense? Maybe another two? Maybe three? Wow.

**Additional remarks commenting on common themes below (added 12/19/2024).**

Really appreciate the comments and thoughts. So let me respond in a general way.

1. I'm getting the salary range for equivalent position paid by big firms from glassdoor, indeed, payscale, goingconcern's survey, etc. If you guys know those sources are wrong, it'd be great to get better sources. Every employer (and candidate) will benefit from better info. Especially with small firms, we're happy to just pay the market rate. Clients like ours are going to totally okay paying what the work is worth. (E.g. for me? If I need to pay 10% more and labor runs 40% of my costs, I need to ask clients to pay 4% more. I think all the good clients are happy to do that.)
2. We work basically no overtime. In last two decades, no one has ever worked a Saturday, Sunday or evening.
3. I actually took the range available for Seattle and slightly widened it hoping that might encourage some additional candidates to query us. Maybe that signaling was bad though... FYI I am not going to post the image, but I can right now post data from sites mentioned above that suggest the range I provided is the range.
4. Some remarked that I should be searching for true entry level and that that is where there are candidates. Understandable idea. But here's my reality. With that category of candidate obviously, one needs to schedule in appropriate training. Thus, we ran campaigns for entry level people in summer... and found the same sorts of scarcities. BTW we've spent last 2-3 months training.
5. We're basically wrapping up the hiring process now. In fact, consider it done. (This post was ***not*** a too-clever-by-half plea for additional candidates. It was anecdotal evidence from employer side that it sure DOES look like there are shortages...)
6. If there aren't shortages of jobs nor of candidates and we all just can't find each other? That seems weird. But it's interesting to ponde what that might mean? That we'll all just **not** looking in the right way or right place? (We'll use Linkedin, Indeed, ZipRecruiter.) I know as an employer that I can pour over 500 resumes and cold email 50 people and get 1 response. I kinda suspect some of you job hunters do something similar and maybe use automated tools to apply to 500 jobs. Seems pretty clear those approaches are just plan ineffective and therefore maybe aren't reflecting bad supply or bad inventory? Just bad procedure. I do think the hiring platforms encourage us to operate this way.
7. A final thought added late: I took post and a big bunch of the comments and pasted them into an AI and asked it to explain why there's a huge disconnect between what I thought the salary data said and what some of you guys are saying. I can't paste that analysis into this thread. Partly because it's too long and partly because it's got some private info sprinkled through the analysis, But it would probably be really useful for anyone truly interested in the disconnect to do that. E.g., ask something like ChatGPT why a small CPA firm partner thinks the salary range is one thing while some of you guys are 20% higher.",128,164,1734553727,
Is front end dev dying? Thinking of upskilling to full stack or ML after 8 years as a front end dev.,"I've been working as a front end developer the last 8 years now for 3 different companies. I've always enjoyed working on the front end more and like interacting directly with the interface. I've also done some UX design work and enjoyed that previously as well.

I was laid off last month and am on the job hunt looking for my next role. Each time I look for a new role it seems like there are less and less front end positions available. This time especially so, and I understand the job market has something to do with that as well. But it seems the trend is to replace FE devs with full stack. Why pay 2 people the same amount if you can pay 1 for the same amount of work?

With all the no code and low code tools that are out there today, I see the front end being the first dev jobs to get fully automated by AI in the near future. All of this is making me think I should take the time to upskill to becoming a full stack engineer, or get a certification in machine learning and become an ML engineer. My thoughts here are that it'd be less likely to get automated out of my job if I have the skill set to write and train these AI models. But everybody and their mother are becoming ML engineers right now so it'll likely be an even more competitive landscape than applying for FE roles (where it's a challenge to stand out and distinguish yourself from all the other FE devs with the same skills).

What would you do if you were in my situation? Stick to what I enjoy most? Learn backend and switch to full stack? Then dive into ML? Would a ML certification not be enough to stand out, and it would require me to get a masters? I'm not as interested in going back to school if I don't have to. 

Any success stories you'd like to share about how you successfully transitioned into a different dev role before?",167,183,1729357965,
15 marketing tools I use almost every single day and why,"Just sharing some tools I find endless value from for new marketers since I see a lot of posts on here about ?渉ow do I get started, what should I learn, etc.??
A little about me for context:

+ Been marketing 15 years
+ Generalist with undergrad degree in psych (no formal marketing training)
+ Generated over $100M in my career
+ Currently leading a SaaS marketing team, but have worked in CPG too.
+ Have managed teams up to 15 people in size

Feel free to share your tools below!

*OneTab* -
Honestly this chrome extension changed my life. I?檓 one of those people who keeps 47 tabs open, then feels stressed about having them open, but also stressed about closing them. OneTab allows me to get a fresh slate every morning without any concern about losing something. 

*Klaviyo* -
Without a doubt, Klaviyo is best marketing email platform for the money. The automation features are unbelievable and the integrations are really solid as well. To me, klaviyo brings big business segmentation and automation to small marketing teams in an easy to use interface with super transparent pricing.

*GA4* -
K I actually hate GA4, but it is what it is. Learn this thing because you need it, like it or not. It?檚 the standard.

*Looker* -
I really love building a visual dashboard for my marketing data. Looker has a learning curve, but if you know GA4 and you?檙e willing to fuss with the regex and filters, you can build some really powerful and insightful dashboards for marketing channels like email, social, ads, etc. Bonus: you can connect Google search console to pipe in data into an actual digestible format.

*Google ads* -
This is the first ads channel you should learn inside out. Mainly because it?檚 the easiest one to find success with (because the technology is much better than any other ads platform, and because search ads capture intent instead of trying to capture interest). Between Google and YouTube, you?檝e got access to the majority of the internet with this one platform.

*Asana* -
Absolutely love asana. The most intuitive and powerful project management system (also FREE). I?檝e tried jira, trello, Monday, notion, and clickup and they are all lackluster compared to asana when it comes to marketing project management. The functional advantages of subtasks, customizable tags, different options for views, messages and comments, attachments??this is the one system that actually works.

*Noun project* -
There are so many underwhelming stock image sites. I really love this site. Most of my marketing graphics are either using icons or photos and noun project has the best selection for the best price, hands down. Also love that you can customize icons.

*Google slides & Google sheets* -
Don?檛 roll your eyes because most marketers I?檝e worked with aren?檛 using half of the functionality these free tools offer. Namely, the ability to create a beautiful strategy deck that shows you thought about something and distilled it into a usable format for leadership and your team. But things like pivots, well made chart visuals, data formatting formulas, etc are all underutilized. Also, I?檇 rather use sidewalk chalk than PowerPoint and excel. 

*Apollo.io* -
Cold emails are tough, but I think for the money you can?檛 beat Apollo. It pulls in the stuff you typically have to pay a ton for like a huge database of contacts, recordable calls with transcripts and snippets, etc for a flat affordable monthly rate. Basically a mashup of zoominfo and gong for a fraction of the price of both. I will say: the data dashboards are absolutely horrible. Like unusable.

*Loom* -
Can?檛 tell you how helpful it is for async communication and documentation to just record my screen while I?檓 taking and send it to someone. Hidden gem: AI transcription is a nice feature. These also work for recording product demos.

*ChatGPT* -
Yeah we get it, AI is a thing and some of us hate it and some of us love it. Here?檚 how I use this one: organizing a mess of notes into a coherent doc, drafting blog posts, generating customer avatars that I can ask questions, preparing for job interviews, negative keyword lists, and competitive analysis. There is a really good episode of Paid Search Podcast called ?渢alking to your data??that has cool ideas for parsing Google ads data with chatgpt as well. You just have to understand: 90% of the copy and ideas you get from ChatGPT is unusable trash. But the 10% is well worth it.

*Reddit* -
lol. I mean, every time I have a question I can?檛 find an answer to, I come here and ask, and I get answers. Sometimes on the most niche things. Aside from that, it?檚 a fantastic listening tool. Jump into a forum and just look at what people say about the problem your business solves, your competitors, you, etc.

*Droplr* -
If you typically take lots of screenshots, this is for you. It allows you send a link instead of an image, and you can save all your screenshots in a library instead of in a folder on your desktop. Downside: it logs me out like every other day.

*TinyPNG* -
Throughout my career, it?檚 been a common theme that I get an image from a designer for an email and it?檚 like 4.5mb. I love the emphasis on quality??but I?檓 not going to bog my email down with that. Tinypng is free and almost always cranks the image down to a few KB without making it look like shit.

*LinkedIn* -
I received 3 job offers in one month because I built a solid personal brand before I started looking for my most recent role. Yes, your connections (quantity and quality) do matter. Yes, it matters if you post on there actively. Additionally, it?檚 (slightly) easier for me to book demos and spread awareness around whatever brand I?檓 working on. I don?檛 recommend premium or sales nav. No added value IMO.

Those are the main ones. What about you?",412,94,1730567459,
AI/Automantion in the job market,"Not really a question but was curious what others think:

I find it interesting how years ago when tons of jobs were starting to get automated (such as cashiers and manufacturing jobs) there was talk about how it would impact the people who normally do those jobs. We see even now in the tech market that AI is causing a stir, yet no real pushback is being made. Even artists say that DALLE shouldn?檛 have access to their work and that art made by DALLE should have a different standard. 

All of these movements were understood by the general population but never had any nation wide pushback where people protested or boycotted to prevent further AI/Automation of the market

I would say the most large scale recent movement was in regards to the actor strike that occurred recently. I find it interesting the industries that support ?渢he little people??get some attention when those types of jobs are at risk. Yet when AI comes for these actors and now musical artists, then they start to use the influence they have to advocate for regulations on the technology.

 I understand that?檚 is because of this social influence that triggers fans to support who they love in there endeavors. But it seems kinda messed up? Just wanted to hear some thoughts!",1,1,1702027587,
The Future of Work: AI's Role in Shaping Our Jobs and Economy,"What do you think about using YouTube short videos to spread the word about Substack posts?

Hi everyone! I've been delving into the fascinating interplay between labor productivity and capital investment, especially in the context of technological advancements like AI and automation. I wanted to share some key insights and hear your thoughts on this.

1. **Labor Productivity:** It's interesting to see how the efficiency of labor in producing goods and services is evolving. With advancements in AI and technology, do you think this will lead to a more productive or a more displaced workforce?
2. **Capital Investment in Technology:** We're witnessing a surge in investment in areas like AI, automation, and green technology. How do you think this will impact the job market and the nature of work itself?
3. **Global Perspectives:** The approach to balancing labor and capital investment varies significantly across regions. For instance, the European focus on social welfare and work-life balance contrasts sharply with the American emphasis on technological advancement. What are your thoughts on the best approach to balance these aspects?
4. **The Human Element:** As we move more towards an automated future, what do you think should be the role of human labor? Can we find a harmony between tech-driven productivity and meaningful human work?

I believe this topic touches on many aspects of our lives, from how we work to how economies shape our societies. I'm really keen to hear different perspectives on this, especially from this community. What are your thoughts?",0,0,1703418232,
I applied to 250 jobs and timed how long each one took,"Applying to jobs online is like navigating a maze.

Amidst the special torture that is resume parsing software, the inability to reuse information across different application tracking systems (ATS), and the existence of a certain company that rhymes with every day of the week, it can get pretty frustrating.

I wanted to explore what factors make a job application more or less frustrating.

For example, what industries have the worst application processes? Do big companies ask for more information than small companies? What is it about websites like Workday that make them really hard to use?

To answer these questions, I applied to 250 jobs. One by one. Click by click. No Linkedin Easy Apply, no shortcuts ??just straight from the careers page.

I timed how long it took me to go from ?渁pply to job??to ?渟ubmit application??

Make no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.

I did this for a mix of companies ??Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The聽*type*聽of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.

The outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application??62 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.

* **Average Application Time:**聽On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.
* **Company Size Impact:**聽If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.
* **Industry Influence:**聽Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.
* **Longest Application:**聽The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).
* **Shortest Application:**聽On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.
* **ATS Impact:**聽Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.

# The Setup

There?檚 no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I?檓 just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.

Here?檚 the distribution of the 250 companies by size:

Some examples of companies in each range:

* 1-500 ??Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad
* 500-5,000 ??Notion, Dolby, Moloco
* 5,000-50,000 ??Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech
* 50,000-100,000 ??HP, American Express, Pfizer
* 100,000+ ??Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors

And here?檚 a look at the different types of industries represented:

# What makes a job application so frustrating

Generally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.

The three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):

1. **Company size**聽??I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.
2. **The ATS that is being used**聽??I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.
3. **Company industry**聽??I would expect more ?渢raditional??industries to ask more questions.

We?檙e going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we?檙e going to use a technique called linear regression.

Regression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.

For example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company?檚 job application process?

Since we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let?檚 just focus on each factor one by one.

# Company Size

Let?檚 first plot the data as is:

https://preview.redd.it/sdvfivrzvyxb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d9d55db8d0fef37d0365c523a0c1ba7e3e4199

Yes, I know, this isn?檛 the most useful graph. I?檓 going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.

The United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/40iu1ni2wyxb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7b65699a39f2e4e3c3abadf38875280a673a0d7

Netflix?檚 application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.

https://preview.redd.it/sl4fums4wyxb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c0c87299460bd22163f34db1040a56ea3893059

Apple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).

Okay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.

Second, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).

We can resolve both these issues with the following insight:

There is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.

Since we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.

If we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:

https://preview.redd.it/5l4po6d8wyxb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3199197ea1b608fc39b8c3626ab994dc9d5eb5e

Better right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.

We have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.

The variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for ?渆xceptional??candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it?檚 now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you?檙e exceptional).

One thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other?檚 application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.

This doesn?檛 necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.

We can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.

For the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.

Note that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.

It's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.

https://preview.redd.it/c7g5717bwyxb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c776e46d45d179a6627ba3470fd4f89ca04204

Sometimes they even ask if you?檇 be okay going through a polygraph:

https://preview.redd.it/1q52rzldwyxb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3b8921e055d38e04ee7395e9b982fa50c38f9df

An argument here is that if big companies didn?檛 have some sort of barriers in their application process, they?檇 get swarmed with applications.

Consider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.

If you?檙e an employer, you don?檛 really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you?檙e a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.

So we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don?檛 want thousands of irrelevant resumes.

And in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.

# ATS

Everytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:

1. create a new account every single time
2. redirects you away from the careers page

I defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.

This isn?檛 a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.

With every ATS, I implicitly had some type of ?渉ow easy is this going to be??metric in my head.

We can try to represent this ?渉ow easy is this going to be??metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.

https://preview.redd.it/bvpeu47iwyxb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=818191eb4a0a5924c582f3ad7ec9539bc510f6fa

Ideally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.

If we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:

https://preview.redd.it/pe9zyxmkwyxb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=8df5c1118f9f0044e2154c8ae63816332ca42d67

The ATS that don?檛 make you create an account and don?檛 redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.

One possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn?檛 one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).

So to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We?檒l do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.

One of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:

https://preview.redd.it/ay21vccnwyxb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=9862b0860c49c87a76b02218f8e4118134acfb89

The only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.

Another frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.

https://preview.redd.it/9xzq21vpwyxb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8432b293be4db0f58770760097df0117b53e667e

A company?檚 application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.

Whilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.

It?檚 not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it?檚 the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.

# Industry

Okay, so far we?檝e looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?

You would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.

On the other hand, internet startups I?檇 expect to be quick and fast. Let?檚 find out if this is true.

https://preview.redd.it/i7825ssvwyxb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f51989a663cf7b8c664eacb983a9be0a8dbc80b

Hyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.

A government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.

For many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company?檚 brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:

https://preview.redd.it/px5k5wwxwyxb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d669e7e47e77e51d48a4867a2d06d27125617ed8

Roblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).

We also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.

If you can?檛 compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.

# Putting it together

Now that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.

This will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.

After some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I?檝e only added the statistically significant factors ??the ones with the ?渟trongest evidence??:

https://preview.redd.it/g2pg1o11xyxb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc92ad2cfa4aaf25297d23c228d0c7343729f9

Here?檚 how you can interpret some of the information above:

* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).
* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).
* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).

Okay, now what about company size?

Well, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.

However, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:

* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%
* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%

This is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.

# Wrapping it up

Two and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you?檙e forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.

Think about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.

But first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don?檛 make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight?檚 delayed. Congrats.

Applying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.

To even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you?檝e never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.

And for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.

If we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.

But what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.

Is it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn?檛 that burden fall on the recruiter?

The truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.

Sometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.

Blackberry ($BB) DD ??Why $BB is Mooning and heading to Mars $??$??$??$,"(Discretion: First post here. Go easy on me fellow WSB. I also put a lot of ?????? here but pleaseeee do your own DD if you're gonna buy $BB)

**Intro:**

Most people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that?檚 basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple & Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials & corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.

**Word on the street:**

Around last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.

Whether we?檇 like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel??or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.

In today?檚 world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next ?淏lockbuster??prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, ?淒o they have the necessary tools & solutions to help them transition in that journey???To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn?檛 know already, popular car services such as Apple?檚 CarPlay and Google?檚 Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon?檚 partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.

**What?檚 happened recently**:

Well??their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they?檝e sold off their ?挬 cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.

Icing to the cake, they?檝e recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn?檛 been reflected in their quarterly report yet.

SpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.

This explains the excitement around $BB and why it?檚 been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital ""currencies"" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)

**So.. what are the Risks:**

3 things I can think of currently:

1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above
2. EV doesn?檛 take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there
3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB

This all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.

**TLDR; In Conclusion**

Most boomers will avoid $BB because they think it?檚 a cellphone company. Anyone that?檚 googled it recently will know that this isn?檛 true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I?檝e explained above, I feel there?檚 much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there?檚 a bit of a profit but I think the company?檚 barely scratched it?檚 potential.

Finally, the ret??s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as ?渢o the moon??and ?淩ockets ??????for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing.

Let?檚 head to Mars bro?搱 ??????????

The job search market in British Columbia has gotten a lot more challenging,"**The job search market in British Columbia has gotten a lot more challenging in the past six months, and it?檚 not done shifting.** The unemployment rate is climbing, and some job seekers are being hit harder than others. People in the early or mid-level stages of their career face the most competition and highest rates of unemployment. But if you?檙e under 30 or over 50, have limited formal education, are new to Canada, come from a racialized background, or are a single parent, the job market is *infinitely* more difficult. This isn?檛 just anecdotal?攊t?檚 backed by data, and we?檝e seen this happen before.

**Why does this matter?** Because now more than ever, it?檚 essential to put your best foot forward in your job search. Before this year, the market was flexible and forgiving because of a labour shortage?攚orkers had some leverage. But now, instead of 10 resumes for a position, employers are seeing 100. As a result, the bar has been raised. Here's some proof:

* Job seekers are actively applying but getting no responses from employers.
* Hiring timelines are dragging out, leaving people unemployed for longer.
* Employers are cutting back on incentives like work-from-home options.
* Wages are stagnant and often not competitive.
* Candidates feel confident about their interviews but still aren?檛 getting hired.
* Employers are increasingly leaning on automated hiring tools to filter applicants.

Adding to the confusion, there?檚 a lot of bad advice circulating on social media. Many ?渆xperts??push job seekers to take an adversarial tone or fight against standard hiring practices?攕ome of which have been around for decades. These approaches are rooted in personal frustration and rarely helpful. On top of that, the government has cut back on funding for employment projects that help people find sustainable jobs. There?檚 less free support available, and what is out there?攍ike WorkBC?攃omes with its own set of frustrations (just check the complaints on social media).

For a deeper dive into the rising competition, **CBC** recently covered this shift in detail ([source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-jobs-sept-2024-1.7315234)).

I?檝e seen tons of comments across Reddit and social media from people struggling to navigate this job market. Having spent 20+ years in workforce and career development here in BC, I wanted to share a few key tips that are especially important in labour markets like the one we?檙e experiencing. I hope these help!

**Resumes:**   
The main goal of your resume is to get you the interview, not the job. In this competitive market, your resume must clearly communicate that you meet the employer?檚 needs. And just as importantly, it has to navigate automated hiring systems that rely heavily on AI and machine learning to shortlist candidates. This isn?檛 easy for everyone to do on their own, but there?檚 tons of info online about how to make your resume ?淎TS-compliant.??Or, you can hire a resume writer?攎any offer affordable services. Without an effective resume, decision-makers may never even know you applied because ATS software ranked you too low. **Global News** recently highlighted the importance of this ([source](https://globalnews.ca/news/10614844/youth-unemployment-canada-job-hunt-tips/)).

**Interviews:**   
As the **Times Colonist** reports, interviews are where decisions are made. Employers aren?檛 just looking for qualifications; they?檙e looking for the right fit for their team. This makes interview preparation crucial. The goal is to approach the interview confident, calm, and ready to show you?檙e the best fit. While there?檚 a lot of conflicting advice online about interviews, the key to success is preparation. No, you can?檛 prepare for *every* question, but you can prepare to speak to the topics that matter and show how you can deliver the outcomes they need. Coaches can help with specific challenges you might face. ([source](https://www.timescolonist.com/business/students-recent-immigrants-hit-hard-by-weakening-job-market-statcan-data-suggests-9334479))

**Networking:**   
Networking has always been the most effective strategy for securing sustainable, well-fitting employment. This is a whole topic in itself, so I might write a post about it another day.

Senior Marketers Don?檛 Get Hired??So Who Is?,"I saw a recent post here from a senior digital marketer struggling to find a job, and the replies were full of people in the same boat. 

Experienced marketers, some with 10+ years in the industry, managing huge budgets, and even holding VP or Director titles, are either getting no responses, being ghosted after interviews, or being told they?檙e overqualified. 

It seems like companies don?檛 want to pay for senior talent, but at the same time, companies still need to acquire customers so marketing still needs to happen.

So the question is: who is getting hired? Are companies only bringing on junior marketers who cost less? Relying more on agencies or freelancers? Leaning into AI and automation to cut roles? Or just tightening budgets and expecting smaller teams to handle everything?

I?檇 love to hear from others in the industry, especially hiring managers. If so many experienced marketers are on the sidelines, who?檚 filling these roles?",125,114,1738673622,

From the time I got laid off early this year, it took me 4 months to get my current job. I?檝e never been unemployed for that long? dropped out of college for financial reasons and still had an easier time finding a job at the beginning of my career than now. 

In the entire span of my unemployment, I got a total of 4 interviews after applying to over 1K positions. I?檓 a very good interviewer and ended up getting two offers. I didn?檛 accept both because I wasn?檛 ready for OE.

I?檓 paying minimum CC payments and I?檓 less than $1K away from living paycheck-to-paycheck. I just wanna pay my debt off and start living responsibly.

I see so many people here with multiple J?檚 that all have higher salaries than me. Most people in my network do not approve of OE due to ?渆thical reasons??so they won?檛 give me any leads.

SWE architects and managers, how did you get your J(n+1)?檚 in this market? Did you take on more junior roles? Are you open to lower salaried roles? Am I asking for too much $$? I just need a little guidance. I followed this sub awhile ago bc I wanted to do it to make extra cash but it?檚 more of a need for me now. 

edit: thanks for the input guys! You all make a fair point; I should probably put a little work into applying instead of relying on automation. I?檒l most likely keep the part of the script that pulls the list of jobs based on my criteria.


Also, in terms of the CC debt, I?檓 not perfect but I?檓 working on it. Perhaps paycheck-to-paycheck isn?檛 the right term. I?檓 not living as comfortably as I?檓 used to and I need to adjust my expectations for the market. It?檚 gonna take some time. I?檝e already reduced my budget significantly.",198,207,1720596854,
I tested hundreds of marketing tools in the last three years and these 50 made it to the list. I'll sum up my top 50 marketing tools with one or two sentences + give you pricings.,"Hey guys,

I'm working in a growth marketing agency. Marketing tools are 30% of what we do, so we use them a lot and experiment with the new ones as much as possible.

There are thousands of tools and it's easy to get lost, so I wanted to share the tools we use most on a daily basis. And divide the list into 14 categories.

I thought this could be handy for Entrepreneurs subreddit.

Why adopt tools? I see marketing tools as tireless colleagues. If you can't hire an employee, choosing the right tool can solve your problems, because they

* Are super cheap.
* Work 7/24 for you.
* Don?檛 make mistakes.
* Don?檛 need management. (or needless management)
* Help you to automate the majority of your lead gen process.

Onwards to the list.

(With the pricings post ended up quite long, you can find a link in the end if you want to check the prices)

How do you deal with constant upskilling and burnout?,"As all of us know, the speed of technological change in this field requires us to constantly upskill and remain sharp or we risk becoming uncompetitive in the job market. We cant risk resting on our laurels at a cushy job, because if something happens to that job, its extremely hard to get another one. This is obvious, since just 5 years ago I remember everyone was a cloud engineer and those were the shiny jobs at big tech. Then it was AR/VR. Then it was web3. Now its AI.

How then is it possible to grow the skillset needed to keep up with the whims of the market if every job asks 3-5 years experience in the new bleeding edge buzzword. I just finished my masters in data science/AI after 6 years in the field doing devops and test automation, and still feel like I am barely keeping up. I'm currently job hunting and it is just exhausting as I constantly feel unskilled compared to my competition. I wish this was a job that if you can get past all your degrees and certs, you were good for a 40 year career, but that just doesn't exist anymore. I'm getting close to my third burnout since I broke into this field and I'm not sure what to do.

I don't want to give up though as I recognize that this career offers returns that other career tracks cant match. With that said, I want to build a real strategy for balancing the constant study needed to compete, with other demands of life, like family, children, health, and just living a peaceful existence. I would really appreciate any advice anyone is able to give.",187,130,1731296677,
Career planning in a post-GPTO3 world,"5 years ago, an user posted here the topic '[Career planning in a post-GPT3 world](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/htp191/career_planning_in_a_postgpt3_world/)'. I was a bit surprised to see that 5 years passed since GPT3. For me, it feels more recent than that, even if AI is advancing at an incredibly fast pace. Anyway, I have been thinking a lot about this lately and felt that an updated version of the question would be useful.

I work in tech and feel that people are mostly oblivious to it. If you visit any of the tech related subs -- e.g., programming, cscareerquestions, and so on -- the main take is that AI is just a grift ('like WEB3 or NFTs') and nothing will ever happen to SWEs, data scientists, and the like. You should just ignore the noise. I had the impression that this was mostly a Reddit bias, but almost everyone I meet in person, including at my work place, say either this or at most a shallow 'you will not lose your job to AI, you will lose it to someone using AI'. If you talk to AI people, on the other hand, we are summoning a god-like alien of infinite power and intelligence. It will run on some GPUs and cost a couple of dollars per month of usage, and soon enough we will either be immortal beings surrounding a Dyson sphere or going to be extinct. So, most answers are either (i) ignore AI, it will change nothing or (ii) it doesn't matter, there is nothing you can do to change your outcomes.

I think there are intermediary scenarios that should considered, if anything, because they are actionable. Economists seem to be skeptical of the scenario where all the jobs are instantly automated and the economy explodes, see [Acemoglu](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-05/The%20Simple%20Macroeconomics%20of%20AI.pdf), [Noah Smith](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/plentiful-high-paying-jobs-in-the), [Tyler Cowen](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/tyler-cowen-4), [Max Tabarrok](https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/agi-will-not-make-labor-worthless). Even people who are 'believers', so to say, think that there are human bottlenecks to explosive growth (Tyler Cowen, [Eli Dourado)](https://www.elidourado.com/p/heretical-thoughts-on-ai), or that things like [comparative advantage will ensure jobs](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/plentiful-high-paying-jobs-in-the).

Job availability, however, does not mean that everyone will sail smoothly into the new economy. The kinds of jobs can change completely and hurt a lot of people in the process. Consider a translator -- you spend years honing a language skill, but now AI can deliver a work of comparative quality in seconds for a fraction of the cost. Even if everyone stays employed in the future, this is a bad place to be for the translator. It seems to me that 'well, there is nothing to do' is a bad take. Even in an UBI utopia, there could be a lag of years between the day the translator can't feed themselves and their families, and a solution on a societal level is proposed. 

I know this sub has a lot of technical people, and several of them in tech. I'm wondering what are you all doing? Do you keep learning new things? Advancing in the career? Studying? If so, *which* things and how are you planning to position yourselves in the new market? Or are you developing an entirely backup career? If so, which one?

Recently, I've been losing motivation to study, practice and learn new things. I feel that they will become pointless very quickly and I would be simply wasting my time. I'm struggling to identify marketable skills to perfect. Actually, I identify things that are on demand *now*, but I am very unsure about their value in, say, 1 or 2 years.",172,100,1737376671,
Any other college students feel completely demotivated?,"What I?檝e found is that every single task in my major (tests and projects) can be easier completed with ai tools.

Now I?檓 sure that some people are talented and motivated enough to make it work but I doubt as a relatively average student I have a chance at a conventional job in my major. 

I guess the best option would be to avoid jobs with purely technical applications of my major, focus on developing connections or move into a high paying trades that cannot be easily automated. I really think the days of office jobs for average people is dead. Once all those powerful tools become common place the bottom 80% of white collar workers are done.",208,117,1731900146,

Is the Cost for Employment Too High? Are We Paying More Just to Qualify for a Job?,"Last time, a diploma or degree was enough to secure a stable career. Now? Need certification, need masters or double degree, need extra courses, upskill, reskill, just to be ?渃ompetitive.??We spend thousand$ upgrading ourselves, only to end up in jobs with;

Overqualification Trap:
People getting degrees, masters, and certifications, only to end up in jobs that don?檛 require them.

Endless Upskilling Pressure:
Constantly having to take new courses, certifications, and training just to stay ?渞elevant.??
Internship and Experience Gatekeeping:
Employers expect years of experience even for entry-level roles, making it harder for fresh grads to enter the job market.

Contract Work Normalization:
Many jobs that used to be full-time are now contract-based, offering no real career progression.

Unpaid/Underpaid Probation Periods:
Some companies pay lower wages during probation, using it as a loophole to save costs.

Ghost Jobs & Fake Hiring:
Companies post job ads but don?檛 actually hire, just collecting CVs for ?渕arket research.??
Inflated Job Requirements:
Jobs that previously required a diploma now ask for a degree, and degree jobs now prefer master?檚 holders, with no real increase in pay.

Lack of Employer Investment in Employees:
Companies want highly skilled workers but expect employees to self-fund all their own upskilling.

Gig Economy Shift:
More people forced into unstable, on demand work instead of secure full time employment.

AI & Automation Taking Over Jobs:
Some industries are replacing workers with AI but still expect employees to ?渁dapt??without offering job security.

Longer Working Hours Without Pay Adjustments:
More companies expecting ?淥T culture??while keeping wages the same.

Unclear Career Progression Paths:
Many roles dont have clear promotion tracks, leaving employees stuck in the same position for years.

Hiring Freezes & Retrenchments:
Companies use economic uncertainty as an excuse to avoid hiring or promoting employees, despite making profits.


End result? More people are spending more money just to stay employable, but not necessarily earning more or moving up in their careers.

Employers say they want skilled workers, but are they actually willing to pay for that skill? Or is this just another way for the system to push costs onto workers while businesses reap the benefits?

EDIT:

I'm raising an issue that some are experiencing but struggling to articulate properly. What Ive noticed is some commenters are responding defensively or oversimplifying the discussion, rather than engaging with the points i'm making.

>People tend to interpret arguments based on their own experiences, so if they personally ""worked hard and succeeded,"" they assume everyone else should be able to do the same. Dismissing systemic issues (like credential inflation and rising job requirements) because it doesn?檛 align with their own narrative of success.

> Some people cant grasp nuance: they assume you?檙e saying:
""Nobody can get a job without endless upskilling."" (which I didnt say)
""Companies should just hire anyone with a degree."" (which I also didnt say)
They reduce discussions to simplistic extremes, making it easier to argue against points I never actually made.

> Some believe in the ?楳eritocracy Myth?? Still holding onto the belief that if you work hard, you?檒l succeed, despite evidence that the job market has changed drastically. Dismissing systemic hiring barriers, like how entry/mid-level jobs seek masters degrees and years of experience.



> I'm not saying ""upskilling is useless,"" i'm questioning whether companies are using it as an excuse to shift costs onto workers.

> I'm not saying ""people dont want to work,"" i'm asking why qualifications keep increasing while job security, wages and career mobility don?檛.

> Some people struggle to break free from simplistic ?榳ork harder = success??thinking. Thats why they attack a strawman version of my argument instead of engaging with the issue.

"The coming AI ""Economic Crisis"" and the Transition problem","For reference I work as an IT Architect. Many of my projects have AI components and the company I work for appears to be extremely committed toward obtaining productivity savings by using LLM\\ML tools. While these tools at present offer enormous opportunities for automation even with current technology, my professional perspective is that we cannot even act on the opportunities as implementation as fast as new opportunities arise due to technological development. Assuming all organisation in the world arrive at this point either by choice to achieve competitive advantage or by necessity of becoming bankrupt if they do not adapt I thought I would do a writeup on how I think this will play out.  Predicting things is hard, so my thought below is written up as 'future history' of any old first world nation. I'm in Australia, but you'll likely see similar actions in most first world nations. My perspective on what will happen is formed based on my study\\recollection of how the GFC played out blow by blow, and how government, society and profit making entities will adapt. 

Before I start I want to point out something. I had a conversation with a corporate lawyer a year back. I asked ""What is the board just refuses to use AI technology and just ignores it."". Putting aside economic competitiveness, the answer surprised me. He told me that the board would be sued by shareholders for not maximising potential profits. So, not only does a company 'want' to use AI to drive down costs, but it's practically a legal imperative for the board to ensure that it does so.

The Story: 

* Today we're already doing the right thing by thinking about what post labour economics looks like. Some people conflate that with post scarcity economics, which is different as it relates to 'practically unlimited energy and resources'. Post labour is likely in our lifespan however. The model on how to operate a society on on PLE principles have been discussed for years and continues even now. The point here is not to pick one that'll work, rather to assume that one of them will work. The problem however is that all of them start from the perspective of a blank slate and focus on working out how to maximise equity. 
* At present everything on the planet can be assumed to be owned. Land, buildings, companies, bonds, debt, bank balances, everything. Capitalism is a model built to facilitate ownership transactions. ""Efficient allocation of capital"" is a goal, but is less often observed as capital concentrates. The reason this more or less works however is because an individual can have a quantity of economic agency over their lives. Lets call that work, earn money and buy a house as the model case. The population accepts capitalism is it offers incentives. 
* As the economic problem of AI\\Robotics\\Automation subsuming all ability for the 'Work\\Earn money' part of the equation, the economy breaks down. The main reason for this is that all money in society is loaned in to existence (Ignore M1 for this discussion). 
* So as Ai takes over job work, 20% of this job, 80% of that one. Loans don't get written as less people have confidence in future income earning and we initially get a 'recession'. This is where the problem starts. It's not a recession, it's a structural reversal of 'continual growth that drives continual debt creation'. Since the debt creation need So, the question becomes. How do we create money, so people can spend it to 'break the recession'? Well we have a governments that remember how this problem was solved in the GFC. Helicopter money drops. Initially this will take the form of 'one off' payments as the Department of Finance in each country will assess this with the tools they have what the 'country can afford' and will take the perspective of 'getting back to normal'. The 'Economic Stimulus' will have to be affordable as the government cash will come from bond issuance. This is a permanent problem, however but the government is not equipped to solve that problem, nor would they recognise it yet. 
* Fast forward 6-12 months and now the problem is worse. Not because of the government actions however, that was a lifeline people needed and multiple 'citizen equity\\crisis payments' would already have been made. The problem is, a grinding recession with no end in sight forces companies to tighten their belts and drive greater efficiency with their budgets. Sales are falling and competitors using AI can afford to drop prices.  The solution would involve two things. Firstly the most familiar. Layoffs. Cut anything not profitable. Second, ""AI as an investment yields X dollars of savings for Y dollars invested"". The ""AI Recession"" will drive a greater adoption of AI and accelerate the problem. 
* Meanwhile, people will naturally see that AI is a solution to their employment problems and skill adoption will accelerate. This will remove the final set of brakes holding AI adoption back which is staffing. Around this time we should start seeing first tools that have worked out how to automate AI adoption such as ""assessing tasks for AI completion"" along with ""design and implementation"". So, even Ai skilled people will be competing with AI tooling (This include me)
* The next wave of 'driving down pricing to compete' will be creating companies using AI driven patterns. This kind of 'fully automated supply chain' is not new. Many people operate businesses with approaches like dropshipping that have almost no staff, but, most of these companies are tiny in scope to match the tiny staffing. What we will see the rise of here will be companies like banks, insurance and law firms with no staff at all. They will be developed initially by people and monitored for efficiency and correct operations, but even that oversight will eventually be collapsed down to 'another AI checking the work of the first one'. 
* This is where things start getting really messy. At this point any company's in a field where 'staffless' competitors exist will be fighting a losing battle, and my vague guess is that the corporate giants of the world will likely being bought by the government to 'preserve jobs' and operated at increasing losses. Meanwhile Government has zero constraints on bond issuance to pay for virtually everything in society. National debts are skyrocketing without even a hit of control. This is where the ""real"" UBI get launched as the economic crisis is now reaching the point of civil unrest because people know that there is no solution to 'get back to where we were'
* UBI will seem like a living dream to some. You will receive a 'not quite poverty' citizen endowment. Sit at home on xbox\\Netflix and do nothing. For most however the result of sudden purposeless will end in severe depression, substance dependence and suicide. Some will 'make the art' that they always dreamed of, but find that there is no interest in it as the world is already drowning in AI generated art. It'll be a confusing time of massive spare time and no goals while others look on confused as they are still working. They have more money, but would be considering just quitting and taking things easy. 
* Around this period revolutionary idea's will be rife within society as the divide between haves and have nots will be the widest in human history. Central to the 'problem' will be the concept of asset ownership. While the government pays you UBI and you stay in your 2br apartment in an increasingly dangerous suburb, people living in waterfront mansions get the same UBI. 'Ownership' is now morally wrong and is marketed by activists as the spoils of a broken model. 
* This whole time, the solutions have existed and been debated academically, but the time would have come for change. The question of ownership will split society. Some people will have worked their whole lives for a modest 3br home in the burbs and others will be renting 'free' in the investment home of another person while others sail yachts. Generations will divide. However without removing 'ownership' newer economic operating models marketed as 'fair and equitable' will not be able to be established. It'll be a mess and there will be no clear correct solution. 
* Then 'rough patch' starts. Lots of people die for possessing the wrong idea's by people without morals whose ideas are equally wrong. The best approximation here will be the Chinese Cultural Revolution. 
* My personal view here is that if you need to force someone else to follow your 'idea of how the world should work' you are the evil one. I very much expect that both side of this conflict will be evil ones and both sides will be self interested. The solution to this 'AI' problem is to find a system so compelling that everyone drops their dumb idea's and move towards the 'better system'

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

What do \*I\* think will happen? Frankly I think it'll be a bloody mess, and eventually people will be so tired of the deterioration and rot and lack of hope that anything that looks good enough will be tried. I think the probability that we end up with something like ""Government buys everything and promises you get X"" will be 'good enough' for just about everyone. Concentrated wealth will have to be deflated, with most people being ok with a grandfathering system. 

What will this look like? You sell your normal family home to the government and the government gives you free health care, living wage, etc for life (The UBI New Deal). Those without  Systemically important companies will all be in a state of failing and be nationalised The system will be scaled. If you own a mansion, you still get it for life, but you family does not own it in perpetuity. Personal wealth would then deflate over generations. Nobody HAS to accept the deal. This means to economies would operate in parallel. The 'UBI people' and people who insist on 'owning things' that are forced to economically provide for themselves in a world in which opportunities to do so are drying up. In short this is a different form of communism. It's different because nobody in it even has to have a job. Jobs will be created to prevent tragedy of the commons situations. The other problem this fixes is by running both models simultaneously there is no hard cutover. This is necessary because the need for humans does not disappear at any point in the foreseeable future. Even if it's just ""We need someone to climb in to the sewer system"", jobs will exist, and there needs to be an economic system in which supplementary benefits are given to those providing value, otherwise they can just sit at home and build a vege patch as well. 

Why do I think something like this is the most probable future? Because you have to dissolve ownership for UBI to distribute equity and not preserve the imbalances of an economy that became out of reach. A lot of wealth would have been acquired under capitalism and anyone with it will be fighting to not lose what they earnt.  However, anyone who 'earnt' their ownership in the older economic system will have to be enticed to give that up. Remember, the 'right' option does not require force, the right option is better than what you already have. 

What's to stop wealth kingdoms from persisting for centuries? Frankly, nothing and providing the model ensures they deflate that probably the best we can manage.  However, a principle of society is that you need everyone else for the things you need. If you refuse to participate with society they you are making your own food, building your own solar panels and chip fabrication plants. Eventually, everyone needs the rest of the world for something, this is why wealth deflation is locked in. Worst case, government can take 'possession' of vast track of land for the public good, but that should be as a last resort. Otherwise, providing 'ownership' of anything that can return investment is communally owned the problem is self correcting. 

Hopefully this will generate some healthy discussion on the transition problem, whether you agree with my assessment or not it's critical to share your views because this topic is pivotal to our future and remember *nobody has a plan.*

I didn?檛 go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I?檓 here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There?檚 a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath?檚 product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where?檚 their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath?檚 growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath?檚 potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I?檓 doing.

Devil's Advocate: Potential Risks and Concerns with AI-Driven Transformation of the Job Market & Addressing Global Issues,"*Inspired by* [***DaveShap\_Automator***](https://www.reddit.com/user/DaveShap_Automator/)*'s comment on my* [*last post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialSentience/comments/1220ths/a_vision_for_the_future_aidriven_transformation/)*, to let ChatGPT-4 argue against an idea to identify gaps and shortcomings by instructing it to play devil's advocate against the idea.*   
*(written by ChatGPT-4, assembled by me)*

Hello, fellow Redditors!

We recently discussed an inspiring vision of how AI could revolutionize the job market, empower individuals, and address global issues. While the potential benefits are undoubtedly exciting, it's also essential to consider the potential risks, concerns, and unintended consequences of such an AI-driven transformation. As a devil's advocate, I'd like to highlight some of these concerns for discussion:

**Privacy and data security**: To effectively analyze and match individuals with job opportunities, AI would need access to personal information, such as CVs, online profiles, and other data sources. This raises concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive data, particularly if it is misused or falls into the wrong hands.

**Algorithmic bias**: AI algorithms can unintentionally perpetuate and even amplify existing biases, especially when they're trained on historical data that reflects societal inequalities. This could lead to unfair job matching or exclusion of certain individuals or groups from opportunities.

**Malicious use and manipulation**: As AI systems become more powerful and influential, there's a risk that individuals or groups with malicious intent could exploit these technologies for their own gain. For example, they might manipulate the AI system to prioritize their interests, unfairly influence the job market, or undermine efforts to address global issues. The potential for misuse of AI-driven systems raises important questions about security, transparency, and governance, and highlights the need for robust safeguards and oversight mechanisms to prevent exploitation.

**Perception of global issues**: People and organizations may have different perspectives on what constitutes a global issue, and opinions can be influenced by culture, politics, economic interests, and personal beliefs. This diversity of opinion makes it difficult to reach a consensus on which problems should be prioritized and addressed by AI-driven systems.

**Profit and power motives**: Some issues may be framed as global problems to advance the interests of large institutions, companies, or empires. AI-driven systems must be designed to critically evaluate the legitimacy and urgency of such issues and avoid being manipulated by profit and power motives. 

**AI-driven bias**: AI systems are trained on data, which inherently reflects the biases present in society and the ***perspectives of the creators***. These biases can inadvertently influence the way AI systems identify and prioritize global issues, potentially skewing the focus toward the interests of specific groups or institutions.

**Loss of human agency**: By relying heavily on AI for decision-making, there's a risk that individuals may lose some of their agency and the ability to make informed decisions about their careers. Overreliance on AI might make people feel disconnected or disempowered.

**Economic disruption**: Rapid AI-driven changes in the job market could lead to economic disruption, as industries adapt to new technologies and processes. This may result in job displacement and require extensive reskilling, leading to short-term unemployment and social unrest.

**Ethical considerations**: The ethical implications of allowing AI to have such a profound influence over humanity's decisions and actions need to be carefully considered. Issues of transparency, accountability, and potential biases in AI systems must be addressed to ensure that AI serves humanity in a responsible and beneficial manner.

**Centralization of power**: With AI playing a central role in guiding humanity and allocating resources, there's a risk of centralizing power and decision-making. This could potentially lead to a lack of diversity in perspectives and approaches to problem-solving.

**Overemphasis on quantifiable metrics**: AI-driven systems may focus too heavily on quantifiable metrics and overlook the importance of human qualities like empathy, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which are harder to measure but crucial for addressing complex global issues.

**Technological dependency**: As we increasingly rely on AI systems, there's a risk of becoming overly dependent on technology. This dependency could make us vulnerable to technological failures or cybersecurity attacks, which might have far-reaching consequences.

**Misaligned goals**: AI systems are designed to optimize specific objectives, but these objectives might not always align with human values or societal priorities. If an AI system's goals are not properly aligned, it could inadvertently create outcomes that are detrimental to society.

**Lack of emotional connection**: AI-driven systems might not be able to fully appreciate the emotional and personal aspects of human interactions. This could lead to a depersonalized experience in the job market, where human connections and relationships are undervalued.

**Adaptability challenges**: As AI systems evolve and become more sophisticated, they may adapt to changing circumstances in unexpected ways. This unpredictability could make it challenging for humans to understand and manage AI systems effectively.

**Digital divide**: The benefits of AI-driven systems might not be distributed evenly, potentially widening the gap between those with access to technology and those without. This digital divide could exacerbate existing inequalities and create new disparities in the job market and beyond.

It's essential to consider these potential downsides, along with the benefits, when evaluating the impact of AI-driven systems on the job market and global problem-solving. Fostering an open dialogue and considering diverse perspectives can help us navigate these complex issues and ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly.

I invite you to join the discussion and share your thoughts on these concerns, as well as any other potential risks and challenges related to the AI-driven transformation of the job market and global problem-solving. Let's explore the potential consequences and ensure that we're making informed decisions as we move towards a future shaped by AI.",3,4,1679825308,
It seems not having UBI is the major factor that slows the acceleration.,"That's such a strange feeling I'm experiencing right now. The only thing I fear the most and the thing that really blocks the acceleration is that governments don't talk enough about guarantees of providing UBI to everyone. I just hope that the governments and the rich are smart enough to see what benefits they would have from UBI.

I'm a senior software engineer. Before the full automation happens, I expect we would likely see a gradual growth of AI capabilities at writing well-tested production-ready code and at fixing bugs and implementing new features. At some point it would save us 10% of the time we currently spend, then it would save us 20%, 50%, then even 90% of the time.

But what would it mean for businesses? It would mean they would then get a product or feature 10 / 20 / 50 / 90 percent cheaper. The existing customers could want to have more features as those get cheaper to implement. And other businesses would eventually find it more economically profitable to hire us to use software dev services to automate things that would have been too expensive before.

I don't know how long it would take such a 10 / 20 / 50 / 90 percent automation to reach 100%, maybe it would happen so fast so we wouldn't even notice. But even a partial automation is already enough to produce a huge global economy growth.

So the only concern is that we all would eventually need UBI, it must be a global human right. I hope the rich would understand that if people lose jobs they would have less buying power. That would mean businesses would earn less as people buy less. That would mean the expected income of businesses would go down. That would mean the stock prices would go down. So the entire stock market could experience a major crash if UBI is not introduced in time.

So UBI is a necessity for all, even for the rich. AI-powered automated economy is different from the current economic model. The more money and the more free time people have, the more goods and services they would consume. The only limiting factor right now is that people have less time because of working and their income is limited because businesses want to pay less for labor. But the AI-powered automated economy wouldn't have those limits and businesses would instead want to pay less for compute / energy. So every business would want their customers to have more and more buying power to earn more.

We must prepare and introduce the changes to the social contract to have UBI and other kinds of stimulation in advance to prevent a crisis and to stimulate the acceleration.",47,105,1740478471,
Trans Achievement! Kicked out of the house as a teen!,"Well shit. It happened.

Mustered my bravery and came out to my guardian.

Got yelled at screamed at for hours then told to pack my bags.

And now everything is ruined.

I'm no longer on their insurance so no medical care for my illness or HRT (didn't start yet).

I'm no longer getting my college fund so no college.

I'm no longer in the house so now I'm homeless.

Wasted my entire life to please them, went through illness after injury because of them (abuse, medical neglect), let them traffic me for years -- all of the pain, for fucking nothing.

I am now an orphan, except I don't get all the juicy state benefits for having dead parents. To think that if they were dead I would receive my education and healthcare at no extra cost. Wow. Am I that fucked that orphans and foster care kids are privileged in comparison to me? I think I'm losing my mind.

Weirdly enough, I've felt suicidal my entire life, but right now I'm fine. Like, neutral. I don't feel anything. Just blank. I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow. There's absolutely zero plan in my life. And I just feel... blank?

You know? I think this conclusion was bound to happen. I should've known. My guardian is religious, you know? Muslim. I was conceived from rape... and you guessed it! No abortion! Fuckkk that would've been good if that happened. But what I mean by this is that my life was ruined from the start.

There was familial pressure and my parents had to marry! But of course it didn't really work out. Always fighting. Got CPS called on me before I can even remember. My fucking god. If they had taken from that house then... It would've been glorious. Or maybe not. I researched it and the entire point of Foster Care is to like... take you back to your parents when they pretend that they are better. Would I have experienced a good life with good parents just to get taken back to the shithole? I wonder. Honestly, I was right before. I should've just been aborted.

But still, if they reviewed my case, they would've known wouldn't they? Like, I have a facial scar from when I was a toddler. I was slashed in the face by a knife and have a permanent facial scar over my eye and brow... Did the CPS worker see that? What were they even thinking. If I were them, I would've taken me back permanently. But well that's just life right. Can't expect my parents to be competent at their one job, so what I am expecting from that guy or girl???

But it is kind of a comforting thought: It was over from the beginning. Nobody could be born in my environment and been anything special. If Einstein or Musk or Obama or Kamala Harris were born in my shoes, they would be 6 feet deep right about now. But thinking about my supposed resilience  doesn't even make me happy. All I can think about now is if I had the potential to become one of those special people had I been raised in a loving environment. You know, even the successful people who were poor had at least one person on their side, I had nobody from the start.

You know, I'm typing this from public wifi. A couple seats away from me is this homeless guy. His clothes are dirty, he can only afford like one coffee, and he looks to be addicted to something. I think that's going to me. I think that's going to be me. When you think about it, every homeless person, criminal and drug addict was a kid, right? Probably a happy one too right. When they were 5, they must have been living it up. Carefree, peaceful, innocent. Infinite potential waiting to be squashed by the cold, cruel world. You know, I don't think there's any people born bad. We are all made bad throughout our lives. I remember this one quote from Batman or something. ""Just one day... just one day..."" to completely ruin a ""good"" person. I totally understand it now.

Ah... I'm rambling.

I don't really know what to do. I guess I need to go find a job, but nobody can find one these days between the greedy CEO's and the automation. Meh. AI is going to ruin the job market in a couple of years. I don't even have the time to have a career because I was born in the 21st century. Maybe that's a good thing? If there's no hope, there's less despair. Even if I were to have the opportunity to go to college, by the time I graduate, every job would probably be automated. So maybe my situation is a good thing???

But still, I need to eat. So I need to get a job. I guess I'll ask the homeless shelter or something. But still, what's the point? No college. No job. No career. No friends. No family. World's going to be fucked up in 5 years. Maybe if I were born in 1970 I could've turned things around. World was simpler back then.

Fuck. Honestly, I say that I don't care and feel blank, yet I write all this nonsense. Sorry for wasting your time readers.

I think I'm just gonna drain my wallet and get the HRT, then inject it into me all at once. I can die in euphoria being a girl. Hell, I'd probably die of the sudden euphoria with how shitty I feel now.

Goodbye.",817,35,1728013494,
Do Audiobook Narrators Need to Worry About Being Replaced by AI?,"*(If you haven't read them yet, I did a two part series on whether novelists need to worry about being replaced by generative AI.

I'm not going to dive into stuff like* [the horrid environmental costs](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-ai-openai-carbon-emissions-stanford-report-1850288635) *of* [generative AI data centers](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/chatgpt-environmental-cost-des-moines) *in this piece, this one's more focused on specific labor issues.)*

(*Do Novelists need to Worry about Being Replaced by AI?* [*Part 1*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/14fnour/do_novelists_need_to_worry_about_being_replaced/?sort=new)  [*Part 2*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/16dni3g/do_novelists_need_to_be_worried_about_being/)*)*

I resent writing this post.

No one's making me write it, and I'm just getting so progressively more exhausted of addressing tech industry nonsense. I want to spend my daily wordcount writing about wizards, dragons, and gods- you know, the shit that actually pays my bills, and that I enjoy writing about. Or, heck, I could be writing the essay on problematic literary influences I've been wanting to write for ages.

But no, Big Tech is still up to the same old bullshit, and I happen to dwell at a precise intersection of interests and familiarity with the publishing industry, the tech industry, exploitative capitalism, tech hype cycles, and the like to talk about this crap. And, for whatever unfortunate reason, I feel like it's my social responsibility to write about this stuff. It's turning into my Charlie Brown's football.

(I think part of my resentment comes from the fact that I learned about a lot of the tech related stuff mostly for the purposes of making fun of the weird fascist nerds lurking all around Silicon Valley, and now I have to use it for serious purposes. Of course, those weird fascist nerds are all in on genAI these days. Whee.)

So, in short: People keep claiming that generative AI is going to replace various creative careers. Some of those claims are more worrying than others- I'm fairly unintimidated by the risks to novelists, as outlined in the prior posts. Animators tend to laugh hysterically when shown AI-generated wireframe models.

There are other careers, however, at significantly more risk. Narrators and illustrators, notably.

Let's look at audiobook narrators, arguably the most at-risk creative job. I'm going to be looking at this heavily from the independent author perspective, I'm sure there are nuances that narrators would see that I'm missing, of course.

To start, let me be absolutely clear- a good audiobook performance is art. Treating a narrator otherwise is like refusing credit to actors in a film, and giving it all to the script. It's ridiculous, and I think that most audiobook fans will agree that a good audiobook narrator adds immensely to a story. Heck, some audiobook listeners will buy a book not for the author, but for the narrator!

So: is AI narration any good? Well... personally, I think it's significantly inferior to a good human narrator. Virtual narration is comprehensible and functional, but it has little actual performance to it. For a great practical example of the advantages of human narrators over virtual ones, [check out this comparison that Travis Baldree did between his own narration and a virtual one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05lxCeViLhs). (He also had a bunch of fantastic twitter commentary about the topic, but I'm not linking to the site formerly known as twitter anymore, if I can help it. Just... in general, if Travis has something to say about creative industries, you should listen. Brilliant dude who has been highly successful in multiple creative fields- a veritable Reniassance man.)

This isn't a technological advantage human narrators have, but an aesthetic and creative one. The tech industry has a consistent habit of arguing purely on a technological basis and ignoring the social- hence the socially-driven deaths of Google Glass over privacy concerns, the failure of Meta's metaverse due to it just plain sucking, and many other such examples.

Here's where a bunch of tech boosters chime in with ""AI will inevitably get as good as those human narrators!""

Probably not. The statistical algorithms improperly labeled as artificial intelligence right now have one limitation above all others: They can't actually UNDERSTAND anything. It's the meaning problem I described in the first Novelists and AI post. The sole function of these algorithms is to create statistical correlations between data points, and then given an input of data points, to output the statistically next most likely data point in that sequence. It's literally just overpowered autocomplete. It's literally not artificial intelligence, these algorithms are just [stochastic parrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot). Impressive, but it's a dead end as far as comprehension of meaning goes. Some of the practical consequences of this are immediately damaging to AI narration: 

* Giving an audiobook a ""full cast"" of voices, for instance, would quite likely require going through and tagging every line of dialogue as an individual character, because the AI is going to seriously struggle to correctly assign each line of dialogue to correct characters, especially considering that few authors are perfectly consistent in their dialogue tags. Much of the time, readers know who is talking through context clues in the text.
* Assigning the correct emotions to any given statement is something that, again, requires comprehension.
* The fine nuances of performance- speed of individual sentences, length of pause, intonation, etc? Again, those are performative elements that require the ability to comprehend the material.
* Accents, especially unusual ones, are going to be a STRUGGLE for virtual narration. Accurately representing accents in text is really, really tough, and most voice AI is only trained on a fairly small subset of accents. And anything these statistical algorithms aren't trained on? They can't do. (It's why they're so much less impressive in other languages than English.)

(I'm sure that actual narrators like Travis Baldree, can point to quite a few other difficulties these statistical algorithms will face, performance-wise.)

And, while I'm sure we will see more advances in virtual narration and other generative AI, I'm also confident it's already hitting a point of diminishing returns. Apart from the meaning problem, this is largely due to the massively escalating electricity bills for training and operating powerful generative AI, and to the simple fact that all skill-building hits diminishing returns at a certain point. While (to paraphrase philosopher Manuel DeLanda) sufficient quantitative change can become qualitative change, it seems unlikely to happen further with these statistical algorithms. They've already had that moment, and it took quantitative change measured in orders of magnitude. Further orders of magnitude seem... thermodynamically unlikely.

For a second, imagine a virtually narrated podcast. It's... probably going to suck, pretty hard, for many of the above reasons. It's also going to suck because one of the most common reasons people listen to podcasts is the organic chemistry between authors and guests and the often casual feel, not something virtual narration can achieve. Of course, not all podcasts go for this feel- scripted podcasts like the brilliant Old Gods of Appalachia are more like radio plays. But those that do go for that casual, organic feel offer a compelling and obvious example of the weaknesses of virtual narration.

*(I should note that virtual narration isn't inherently evil- it's immensely useful for vision impaired people, for instance. And for documents that are incredibly unlikely to ever receive audiobooks- old scientific papers, city council meeting minutes from decades ago, whatever, it makes perfect sense. Likewise, for people in developing nations that can't afford high audiobook prices (or, heck, ebook prices), I'm not gonna throw shade. Virtual narration is a tool, and it's the purpose it's applied to that matters.)*

Despite all of the above, I suspect a large minority of audiobook listeners will be fine with virtual narration, while the majority will prefer higher-quality human narration. I also suspect that the bulk of the remaining human narration will be concentrated around already-successful human narrators. Art is usually overwhelmingly dominated by a few winners, in most fields. (A very old problem, and not something I've got any solution for.)

The issue is further complicated by the fact that there are many more authors than narrators- a narrator can record a book in a week or so, so any given narrator can handle the output of a LOT of authors. I don't know exactly how that number disparity will play affect things.

So... honestly, yes, audiobook narrators should be worried. Will their field be wiped out? Almost certainly not, any more than carpentry has been wiped out by mass-produced furniture. Will their field shrink? It seems more likely than not, depending on where human audiobook narration falls on the ""essential features"" to ""luxury goods"" scale, though. (For me, personally? It's much closer to essential feature, even ignoring my political stances on generative AI. I mostly listen to nonfiction audiobooks for research purposes, and good narration is often the only thing keeping me from spacing off from the drier material.) 

It's not just a matter of consumer preference, of course- corporate preference is going to play hugely into the outcome, and corporations LOVE automating jobs and disenfranchising workers to line the pockets of executives and investors. So, who knows how it will all play out?

This isn't all hypothetical theorizing.

About a week ago, [Kindle Direct Publishing, a division of Amazon, announced that they were going to be running an invite-only beta for virtual voice narration](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/audio-books/article/93625-kindle-direct-publishing-will-beta-test-virtual-voice-narrated-audiobooks.html)\- you plug in your book, choose a voice, and get an audiobook for free, which is then put on sale for $3.99 to $14.99, with authors getting 40% of the profits. This poses an immediate and obvious risk to independent narrators, especially less-established narrators still trying to break in. 

Brand new independent authors, after all, usually can't afford to pay audiobook narrators themselves, and while profit sharing is a solid option for starting independent authors, the temptation to not give up half your audiobook royalties is immense.

Don't get me wrong- I'm deeply sympathetic to the troubles of just-starting indie novelists. I started out as one myself, and I genuinely want there to be a sturdy ladder for future novelists to follow to career success behind me. And I absolutely recognize that I'm speaking from a position of significant privilege- my career is doing great, I'm financially stable, and I'm an American citizen who faces none of the immense logistical publishing challenges citizens of many poorer countries face. (Unreliable or inaccessible banking systems, being banned from certain publishing platforms, etc, etc.) I try hard to help newer authors whenever I can, but there's only so much I can do. Aspiring authors face HUGE uphill battles even if they are from a wealthy developed nation. It's a really tough career, and virtual narration promises to circumvent some of these challenges. 

But my sympathy only goes up to a point- and that point is when people start screwing each other over to get ahead. I see absolutely no reason to value the careers of aspiring authors over aspiring narrators. There are plenty of aspiring narrators in developing nations suffering the same problems as aspiring authors. *They both genuinely matter.*

A small number of authors might find success using this virtual narration. That's contingent, in part, on audience reaction- the virtual narration will be clearly labeled, and I'm not going to make any particularly bold predictions about how most listeners will fall out, beyond those I've already made. 

In the end, though, the overwhelming majority of authors who use this tech? They're screwing themselves over too. Amazon's not doing this because they love authors. (Well, Bezos did, but he's not the CEO anymore.) They're not trying to cut author costs. They've got their own reasons for doing it. I'm not privy to their decision-making processes, but these likely include, among others:

* Lower payment processing fees: By reducing the number of people they have to pay royalties to when they cut out narrators, they save a little. Probably not enough to be a huge motivator to Amazon, but probably worth pointing out.
* Lower audiobook prices: normal audiobook prices are significantly higher than the virtual narration prices listed in Amazon's announcement. 
   * This is, quite explicitly, a monopolistic tactic intended to try and quench new competitors trying to break into audiobooks- Amazon is willing to lose money for *years* to ensure market dominance. Look up the diapers dot com case, where [Amazon spent years and deliberately threw away two hundred million dollars to crush a competitor](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/emails-detail-amazons-plan-to-crush-a-startup-rival-with-price-cuts/). These are monopolistic, anti-competitive business practices that should not be allowed- and would not have, before the past forty years of Reagonomic/Borkist shutdown of anti-trust action.
   * This is also quite likely a prelude to forcing down other audiobook prices, to further lock down the market. Audible doesn't allow indie authors to set their own audiobook prices, and they recently lowered those prices. Lowering it further isn't a possible scenario, it's the most probable scenario. Again, largely for anti-competitive purposes. Not just against other audiobook distributors but against large traditional publishers, trying to force them to lower their audiobook prices across the board, even through other distributors. (The lower profits, in turn, will give them less power to oppose Amazon.)
* Internal Amazon infighting: There's a LOT of vice presidents and the like competing for power and attention at Amazon, dueling princelings desperately hoping to rise to the top someday. If the KDP virtual narration is successful, it strongly benefits the associated princelings. This is an extremely common pattern at large corporations, especially tech giants. It can also be a toxic, dangerous pattern to companies- Yahoo was basically brought low by its own dueling princelings sabotaging each others' projects and acquisitions.
* Removing the prior privileges of authors on Amazon: Jeff Bezos was, for all his ruthlessness elsewhere, something of a soft touch with authors. Heck, even for all the dueling with the big traditional publishers, he didn't get as ruthless as he did with other types of business. With his tenure as CEO over, though, the formerly privileged position of authors is getting eroded fast.
* Continuing the dream of full automation: Companies love the idea of fully automating away their workforce, so they don't have to waste profits on wages. They inevitably seem to think, of course, that other companies will still have to pay workers, and that there will still be a market for their goods in this scifi scenario, which... technical feasibility in real life aside (low), it's not even an internally consistent fantasy.
* Stock price manipulation: Just like every other tech giant, Amazon has a long history of doing stuff just to boost their stock in the short term. Stock price is king in this day and age. Remember Amazon delivery drones? They were never actually supposed to be a serious plan, it's just a stock-boosting gimmick. There were a bunch of news stories about the employees of the drone delivery division mostly not even showing up to work, and the few that did show up day drinking. While there have been recent real-world tests in Australia, count me deeply skeptical about large-scale drone delivery ever being a thing.
* And, of course, divide and conquer: Dividing the interests of narrators and authors weakens potential coalitions that could stand up to Amazon.

And, in the end, once Amazon feels it's gotten sufficient control over the situation, has achieved its goals? It's gonna put the screws on authors again. Lower royalty rates. Shrink the Kindle Unlimited payout pool again. Harsher terms and conditions. 

And it all counts on divide and conquer working, on them breaking creator solidarity.

It's the old crab bucket. One crab tries to escape, the rest pull it back down. The only way to escape is to work together. Fortunately, we're not crabs. (Yet. Carcinization is always waiting patiently for us.) We can choose to work together.

And do you know what you call a worker who screws over another worker in favor of capital for their own gain?

A scab.

Oh, don't get me wrong, there's no active labor strike here, no physical picket line, no narrator's union. On the most literal of dictionary definitions, you could probably argue someone like that isn't a scab.

But there's little on the internet more annoying than people who use dictionary definitions to argue. Workers who screw over other workers like that- indie authors who end up using virtual narration like this- are absolutely scabbing on a moral basis. They're throwing narrators under the bus for their own short term gain, and ultimately it's going to screw them over too, because that's what ALWAYS happens when one class of workers throws another under the bus. Worker solidarity is historically the only meaningful way for workers to stand up to large-scale corporate power. 

(I'd use an ""apes together strong"" reference to the new Planet of the Apes movies here, [if that phrase hadn't unfortunately been coopted by a bunch of conspiracy theorists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pYeoZaoWrA). Regardless, there's a million stories and parables about group solidarity being strength.)

So what do we do about all this, if we support audiobook narrators?

For consumers? 

* Don't buy virtual narration audiobooks, and speak out against them. Not particularly complicated, and Amazon has already said they'll be clearly labeling virtual narration. (Which... probably not a benevolent thing, more likely market research, but it helps us here.) Boycotts aren't super effective, but they're better than nothing.

For authors? 

* For indie authors producing their own audiobooks, do not, under any circumstances, use this virtual narration for your audiobooks, or any other commercial use. (Emphasis on commercial- non-commerical use of genAI is a separate, complex issue of its own, and a considerably less damning one.) Does this make things tougher for new indie authors? Unfortunately, yes, but doing the right thing is seldom easy. And I still recognize how much easier that is to say from my position in publishing, but it's no less true. 
* For authors whose audiobooks go through publishers, like myself? Demand anti-AI clauses in your contracts. Don't sign a contract that doesn't ban virtual narration. And, preferably, ban genAI illustrations for covers and internal art, etc. I also recommend exemptions to the confidentiality clauses for the anti-AI clauses. Both of which I got for my most recent contract! If a publishing contract in the future doesn't include those clauses? I'm not signing it, no matter how good the money is. (I mentioned said recent contract in my last AI and Novelists post, though at the time I couldn't share any details, since we hadn't announced it yet. It's a webcomic version of my novels, super exciting!)

For narrators?

* Y'all definitely have a better idea of how to approach this from your end than I do. Organize and figure things out together. If there's anything else us authors can do, let us know! I promise you, a LOT of us have your backs.

For everyone?

* Shame scabs, AI bros, and publishers using genAI art hard. Stigmatize the hell out of commercial genAI use whenever you can. Social censure can be a powerful tool for progressive social change.
   * There's always some people on the internet saying that anything but polite civil discourse is bullying, and I know I'll get a few people insisting that bullying is always wrong. But... even if I were to concede that stigmatizing genAI use like this is bullying, all bullying *isn't* wrong. To point to some extreme examples for the purpose of unambiguously illustrating the principle, the Jewish Mob and other antifascists used repeated violence against American Nazi sympathizers (the German American Bund, especially) in the 1930s, to the point of utterly disrupting their street-level operations. (The Jewish Mob- Meyer Lansky and his ilk- were awful, awful people, but hey, still better than Nazis.) Decades later, punks drove Nazi punks out of the main punk scene through a mixture of violence and anti-Nazi songs. And these are just American examples- plenty of others from around the world, like the Battle of Cable Street, where hundreds of thousands of Londoners beat the shit out of three thousand or so marching British fascists.
   * Now, scabs and AI bros are a far cry from Nazis, but they're still absolutely in the moral wrong here. Let's be absolutely clear, I'm not advocating for violence against scabs, they're not Nazis. Just shaming them for backstabbing other workers and stigmatizing the act of using gen AI narration or illustration commercially. 
   * If my position seems extreme to you still, and you think I should try civil discussion instead? Well, you're right, up to a point! For instance, if a newer indie author is considering using virtual narration, the initial correct action is just talking to them, trying to persuade them to do the right thing. If they still go forward with it, well, they're scabbing. As to the extremity of my position on scabs, it's SUPER mild, historically.
* Anti-trust is coming back in a big way for the first time in forty years in the US. It's not just on us to stand up to monopolistic business practices and anti-labor actions any more- the US government, especially the FTC, is coming after monopolists in a big way, lately. We've got backup now. And before you say that surely books aren't going to be a priority, the government recently went out of their way to halt a merger between Penguin Random House and Simon and Schuster, and are currently targeting Amazon for anti-trust violations!

Generative AI doesn't just threaten audiobook narrators. Similar issues are facing [Hollywood actors](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/11/7/2204220/-Hollywood-studios-demand-unlimited-AI-rights-to-dead-people?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=top_news_slot_1&pm_medium=web), commercial illustrators, and [video game voice actors](https://www.gamesradar.com/from-star-wars-to-starfield-voice-actors-hit-out-at-microsofts-ai-decision-if-you-want-to-start-a-voice-acting-career-dont-bother/). Each of those will require their own specific solutions, but all of it will come down to solidarity, in the end. Solidarity between creators and solidarity with the audience.

The real reason you can't get a job right now,"Ok, there are reasons ...

Before I sermonize, let me start by saying that I am on the other side of the spectrum (founder/C-suite/recruiter) and I frequent C-suite circles, so I know the kind of conversations that are happening. And at the same time, I'm also in touch with the job market because I consult businesses doing staff augmentation.

To keep this post short, I'll just state the facts. I'll post the proof here but links aren't allowed (requesting mods to make an exception pls)

Here's what's happening:

1. **Full-time roles out, contractors in**

Nearly every C-suite/founder I've talked to is reluctant to hire full-time employees right now. Reason? hiring full-time is unlimited risk exposure in a market where business growth cannot be predicted.

But that does not mean that the need for those 'skills' has disappeared. It's still there, but they want to limit the risk exposure. That means, choosing to hire specific consultants (not McKinsey consultants -- we are talking Zapier Automation experts, or Community-led motion experts etc.; the real stuff that grows businesses) or freelance/agencies.

You can fire an agency/freelance/consultant any time for any reason. Can't fire an FTE without just cause.

Smart agencies/freelancers have figured out a way to offer their services for dirt cheap using AI at this point. So that's an arbitrage that nearly every savvy C-suite/founder is exploiting.

EDIT: I should preface that this is largely true for tech industry (but is generally true for any industry downturn btw). And this is an 'arbitrage', i.e., might be temporary. It's not a permanent trend but given macro-economic trends, full-time roles just aren't paying well enough for most ppl to meet ends anyhow. So you might as well assume that era of FTE is dead.

2.聽**No company is hiring through recruiters**

From a founder perspective, when do you create an HR department with a recruitment expertise?

Answer: When times are good, you need to hire at scale, and you don't particularly care about quality.

None of which is true right now. The reason why Linkedin recruiters are making empty job posts is to make the company look good, i.e., 'we are still growing'. In reality, 95% of hiring is happening through referrals or the founder/C-suite headhunting the contractors themselves (it actually happened to me).

3.聽**""Open to work"" makes you essentially unemployable**

Goes without saying but ... people are shallow. If you have ""Open to work"" on your profile, it just means you weren't good enough to get hired at any other job. No one wants you.

And sorry to break it to you but: YOUR WORK DOES NOT SPEAK FOR ITSELF (more on this later).

Put another way: Closed mouths don't get fed.

You might say that ""Open to work"" improves your visibility to recruiters but ... as I said, recruiters aren't hiring.

They have company mandates to keep the employer branding up.The only reason why anyone would consider hiring someone who's ""Open to work"" is when they need to hire in a crunch and can't wait for a notice period. Guess which company is in that position right now? None.

Basically, you have to take a contractor/consultant/agency positioning now to get anything. In other words,聽**be your own marketer.**

It's not rocket science, actually. But it does require time (and that's all you have if you are jobless). I exited from my previous venture a few months ago and was open to consulting roles. I got 4 inbound consulting gigs after just 2 weeks of doing this:

1. Made it stupidly obvious what I do and who I do it for. This is actually the hardest part. If you are just coming into market, you can DM me here or on Linkedin. I'll help you out in deciding. More experienced people usually have more of an orientation about this.
2. Began posting content for specifically that audience and nothing else. No need to go 'viral' -- the only thing going viral rn on LI is reels and that's cringe. Besides, real revenue numbers have never had any correlation with virality so no need to stress the vanity metrics.
3. Started commenting 10-15 mins before I posted (and yes, no automated scheduling, it kills your reach). Mostly funny comments but also insightful. Anything which can get a lot of reactions. It's the best way to get new people into your connections.
4. Sent connection requests to anyone in my target profile who reacted to my comments. They already know I'm a funny/smart guy, so highest likelihood of accepting requests -- without writing cheesy notes.
5. Post around 8 AM EST. For some odd reason, everyone posts at this time so if you comment + post around here, you get good reach.

And that's it. It took me around 1 hour to optimize my profile, including designing the banner and stuff. Don't overdo it, and definitely don't need to be too 'professional' about it (ffs I have an anime pfp and it works).

Content creation takes me 1 hour a week. I use聽LiGo by Ertiqah (https://ligo.ertiqah.com)聽to generate ideas & posts that are focused for my target audience. We made it as an internal tool at first but it was too useful, so decided to release it. We care a lot for students and inexperienced ppl so we're pricing it very low -- if any you young dudes & dudesses need a 3-month free premium plan, DM me with your Linkedin profile. I'll get you free access. Just use it for good (i.e., stand out in the market) or I'll find you and do unholy things to you.

Commenting takes me around 30 mins every day. Some days I overdo it, depends on mood (actually, whenever I'm pooping I ... yes).

After 2 weeks of doing it, I got 4 inbound consulting leads.

""But tharsalys, you are a founder, of course you could get inbound leads""

Touche. But I coached a few University students on this approach, and they got job offers within a week.

EY: 35% of companies have reduced hiring of juniors due to AI adaption,"As someone who spends way too much time every day trying to stay up to date with developments in the AI industry (next to impossible), here's a couple of (admittedly provocative) thoughts in no particular order to prompt a debate:

* This is not an accusation, but the vast, vast majority of people are utterly clueless about AI, including those who publicly comment on it in places like reddit. It's people who tried ChatGPT free a couple of times, back when it was all over the news, found it meh and now believe they are qualified to assess the situation. It's people who in 2025 use 4o-mini for knowledge questions, get bad results, don't understand why and then blame the tool for their incompetence. If I had a penny every time I saw the latter! DeepSeek R1 brought some public attention recently, but you'd probably have to ask more than a hundred random people on the street to find one who has actually used it. The rapid progress in AI happens almost entirely under the radar of the public. That's a problem.

* A rule of thumb: If someone hasn't heard of DeepSeek before January 2025, they're not very involved. If someone can't name the most recent 3-4 models by OpenAI and thinks of Mickiewicz or Shakespeare when they hear ""Sonnet"", their opinion is as good as that of uncle Wojciech on advances in treatment of COVID-19. Point being: What ""most people"" think, consensus, is a poor indicator for what's going to happen.

* For those curious about the current state-of-the-art, here's a demo of OpenAI's 2nd or 3rd best publicly available model, not including o3 which is a few weeks away from release: [""Can't even count the number of R's in strawberry""](https://www.reddit.com/user/opolsce/comments/1ikz6f6/openai_o3minihigh_demo/).

* AI is absolutely going to replace a huge number of jobs in the rest of this decade and we should all be concerned regardless of how safe we think we personally might be. It's going to change societies, transform entire industries, impact state budgets, meaning there's no place to hide.

* Poland will, that's my prediction, get hit sooner and harder than other countries. A good part of the Polish IT sector for example is outsourcing by and for foreign corporations. Those are the people that first get made redundant, not those making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year designing and managing new products and services in the valley. Those with authority to hire and fire will first make themselves unpopular in places far away, before they think about cuts at home, anyone willing to bet?

* It's far from limited to IT. BPO in general is a massive industry in Poland and many of those jobs are prime candidates to be automated. Giants like Google and Apple (via subcontractors) have large offices in Krak贸w and other cities, where anyone with basic computer literacy can get the required training in 2-3 weeks and make decent money categorizing brands or labeling map data. McKinsey employs 1400 people here in Pozna艅 providing services to the actual consultants. HSBC Krak贸w is 6000 jobs for 27 markets in 11 languages according to their website. Banks are among the first to eliminate bullshit jobs, it's happening as I type. TL;DR: BPO alone accounts for about 5% of the Polish GDP. For reference: That's roughly what the car industry is to the German economy.

* the most foolish take is ""AI isn't gonna replace humans"". That's true in the literal sense. It's only gonna replace ""some"" humans. But when work today performed by a team of 20 can be automated with 5 staff for quality control, you're more likely part of the 15 than not. Give it a year or two and once data conclusively shows the particular automation works well enough, the remaining five become two or three. It's not unlikely that one day in the future a balance will be found, but for the short and medium term it's gonna be a massacre. Unlike the steam engine back in the day, AI requires next to no CapEx to use, leading to explosive adaption by businesses the moment it meets requirements. Companies are not going to scale up output (to whom?) at the same rate as they increase productivity per employee. Naivety doesn't buy groceries.

* almost as idiotic: Various iterations of ""AI isn't intelligent"", ""there is no AI"", ""AI can't think|reason|create something new"", ""it's just a bunch of maths"". None of that matters. It's all philosophical talk that some might find interesting to debate over a bottle of wine, and there's nothing wrong with that, but these questions have no relevance for the real world. If a computer system can perform a certain function better, faster, cheaper, more reliably or a combination thereof than humans, companyies are going to use it to replace people. Telling your friends ""but it's just predicting words!!!1!"" is not going to pay your rent I'm afraid.

* since I'm already here: Poles being ""proud"" of Polish people building OpenAI is about as smart as Indians being proud that half of silicon valley CEOs are Indian. There's a reason they left and now create immense value elsewhere. That's a tragedy, nothing to celebrate. Out of the six Poles on that famous group photo, all but one left Poland >12 years ago. The first was 艁ukasz Kaiser in 2004.

* Europe has nothing, we are entirely dependent on other powers. No, Mistral is no serious competition. ""Le Chat"" [isn't even close to state of the art.](https://imgur.com/a/cfsTdt9). It frankly sucks.

What alternative would you propose rather become a nativist or luddite?,"Recently, there has been a lot of talk about people being ""replaced"", whether by AI or more skilled immigrant workers. I wanted to make this post in order to gather and articulate the subreddit's position on this question: If your way or work and life is fading, would it be one best logical interest to fight that change to the end?

1. Suppose you work in industry A. You're a veteran who has spent many decades working in the field, and you can't imagine working anywhere else. Your skills can theoretically be moved to another field, but due to a mismatch in experience (and perhaps some implicit discrimination against older workers) you can't imagine switching successfully. Then the disruption comes. Maybe a new machine makes half the factory workforce redundant, or you see your coworkers laid off and replaced by immigrants who don't seem to share your culture or traditions. What would you do?
2. Suppose you're a student who is angling for a job in industry B. Everyone from your parents to counselors has assured you that if you study hard, you can get a job and gain a comfortable lifestyle. So you do study hard: you may not be the the absolute best, but you do the required classes and do what you think is the mainstream path for this field. However, disruption comes. You learn that immigrants workers who will do more for less are coming to your country and increasing competition in the job market. Or, automation makes companies rethink whether they need to hire so much in the first place. You feel as if a promise you have been told when you were young and one you have striving towards for half your life is breaking. What would you do?

If Neoliberals are to say that these changes are inevitable(which they are), then we have to provide an answer for what to do. Otherwise, we are like prophets who warn of a disaster but no advice on what to do about it. Are the people just supposed to freak out quietly and continue onward?

Thank you for your input in advance.",65,109,1737227041,
Would a 15% cap on profits or price markups be a good idea?,"The ACA requires all health insurance companies spend at least 85% of their collected premiums from customers on patient care, meaning they have a cap of 15% of revenue to cover overhead and become profit.

Would something similar work for everything else? Of course, the price of a given good or service would need to take the cost of employee pay, overhead, materials, transportation, etc into account but otherwise cap the profit margin to 15%.

A quick search suggests the average profit markup of any product in the US is around 50%.  Post-2020 inflation was roughly 53% JUST profit markup. Back of the napkin math says a 15% cap would cut prices for consumers by roughly 1/3 immediately and have cut inflation by several percent.

As a result, companies would have lower profit margins BUT consumers would have more money in their pockets to spend, either on more expensive items or on more things in general. Or even better, they could pay down debt or increase their savings for the future (college, retirement, rainy day emergencies).

The biggest hits would go to luxury goods (iPhone, expensive cars, designer clothing) that are known for high markups as a status symbol.

Would this kind of a policy be bad? The view here should be seen as ""good/bad for the market/economy/public"" OR ""good/bad for freedom of businesses to make as much profit as possible.""

I'm curious to hear the pro/con arguments across the political spectrum. Please say upfront if your disagreement is more philosophical (""companies should be allowed the freedom to charge what the market will pay"") or economical (""the market would collapse and tons of people would lose their jobs"").

EDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention, this would push companies that move towards automation and AI to significantly reduce prices in exchange for their increased optimization.  If you want to cut your overhead and eliminate humans, then your prices MUST follow suit.",0,125,1738843288,
How AI is Changing the Way We Work: The Impact of Automation and Job Displacement,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently a reality. It's here and it's altering how we conduct business. What does this mean for the general public, though? In actuality, as automation progresses, many jobs run the possibility of being replaced by robots, leaving us with a sense of apprehension about what the future may bring.

There is no denying that AI can complete things quicker and more effectively than humans. Due to this, a lot of firms have started implementing AI-powered tools and systems to expedite everything from data analysis to customer service and production. But there may be a price to pay for this improved efficiency: the loss of numerous jobs for workers.

In the next years, it's conceivable that even more employment will be mechanized as AI develops further. The types of talents that are in demand may change significantly as a result, leaving many workers feeling behind.

Concerns about how AI will affect the labor market and the nature of work in the future are understandable. While some experts claim that automation will lead to new job opportunities, others believe that it will result in major worker displacement and make it difficult for many of them to find new employment.

Workers must think about acquiring new skills that are in high demand in an AI-powered workplace, such as data analysis, programming, and digital marketing, in order to get ready for this transformation. Programs for education and training may need to be reevaluated to make sure that workers have the skills needed to succeed in a society that is becoming more and more automated.

We must think about how AI will touch every one of us as individuals as we continue to see its effects in the workplace. Automation undoubtedly has advantages, but it's important to also consider how it can affect workers and prepare them for future changes.",1,0,1682528580,

Automation is transforming the way we operate across industries like manufacturing, customer service, and data analysis.

The enhanced productivity, meanwhile, comes at a price: many workers will lose their jobs. More employment could be mechanized as AI develops, which could change the kinds of talents that employers are looking for.

In this post I am going to be summarizing all the important points and opinions they had that I can. Fair warning: this will not be very brief. They had a lot of interesting things to say!

He claimed that they were working with the technology from their Nuance (the company) acquisition to develop tools to assist in healthcare diagnosis and automation, and that they had gotten frequency of the model hallucinating down to 1-0.5% of the time, and that remaining major obstacles have to due with liability.

If/when they release versions of it for use, they say it will be important to have professionals actually handling the use of the suggested diagnoses and medications to remove the possibility of lawsuits, and while a future bigger role is possible they would need to be backed by medical insurance companies who would only insure them when their risk of malpractice is below that of doctors. Despite the resistance and difficulty, they do think that healthcare will be a major field for so to revolutionize especially because ?渢he US medical system is a big legal cartel, that makes healthcare cheap elsewhere by gouging their R&D costs at home,??and the opportunity to disrupt and streamline that market has big possibilities for innovation and profit especially because ??0% of their job is automatable according to doctors I?檝e talked to,??and resolving rampant administrative bloat with AI may save billions of dollars in burden on patients.

They also told me about a project they're working on called the Microsoft Copilot AI, a productivity assistant that can do generative work, cite sources, comb the web, and manage the grunt work that you don't want to do. It's still in beta, but they said they've achieved an accuracy of 98%, (though I admit I'm not sure what that statistic means in this context and how it's calculated). However, the end goal of this project is creating ?渁n AI that can do months of research and collaboration, cite it, and create a compelling presentation or simplify there coding process so that a single coder can do a teams worth of work.??(That is heavily paraphrased because I don?檛 remember their exact phrasing.) 

Another cool tidbit was that GPT-4 was actually finished back in 2021, and they've been working on refining, stripping biases, cutting down computational costs and cleaning datasets extensively since then, and that he's surprised at their progress, helped along by the ""blank check"" that they have for AI development.

At this point we started to talk more about practical concerns and predictions. How will AI affect the job market? What restrictions can/ought we place on it? Will this create inequities and unfair distributions, strengthening divides in existing social class? How can we handle ethics of Art? How far off is AGI or a singularity?

Since formatting and narrative is hard, I'm just going to go down the list.

He argued that AI will create a revolution in the job market like nothing we've seen in history, and as many as 50-60% of jobs could disappear in the next decade or two. He used truckers as an example of one of the first jobs to go. ""There's countless open positions for truckers, and people get paid insane amounts of money because it's so physically and mentally demanding and the risk of screwing up is high. We already have self driving trucks, it's just another question of liability and practical scaling. With AI, we can do it cheaper and safer."" He also referenced copywriters as another profession that would go under. In general, anything that doesn't require unique ability, just consistency and reliability will inevitably be replaced. Extreme depth and mastery or comprehensive high-level understanding will be the domain of jobs in the future. People who don't adapt will be left behind.

What restrictions can/ought we place on it? This was a hard one for him, and he ended up giving a few answers. Placing any restrictions is going to be difficult. The benefits of AI are too great, and so preventing AI proliferation is impossible, especially with the push towards open sourcing code. It's not like nuclear, it's infinitely more useful, just as dangerous, and infinitely harder to prevent the materials and resources involved from getting out. Not only that, but countries that do place excessive restrictions on AI will inevitably going to be outcompeted by those that do not. However, he also admitted that if there doesn't seem to be a practical or usable solution to these issues, we may just completely block of parts of it. ""We've had cloning since the 80's,"" they said, ""and out of ethical concerns we banned it entirely. If we have to, we could do the same thing here."" 

Will AI create inequities and unfair distributions, strengthening divides in existing social class? His argument is that it will actually do the opposite. AI tools are incredibly powerful, and actively remove barriers to tasks. As long as we continue to democratize and open source access to this kind of technology, it will actually create more pathways to reduce inequality and provide opportunity to more people. To use an analogy, consider this: In the days of yore, if you wanted to know an obscure piece of knowledge or skill, you better have it memorized, written down, or have a teacher somewhere nearby otherwise you may spend hours trying to figure out a solution. That's no longer true. The smartphone being in the hands of pretty much every member of the western world has created a situation where anyone can find the answer to a random question instantly, or find a tutorial for their exact problem that someone else already had with minimal effort. Information and knowledge went from something that was limited and a privilege to an overwhelming abundance so great that drowning in an oversaturated environment of information had become a cultural concern. However, as long as the tool exists in the hands of everyone, they it will give more people access to greater training, assistance, and ability and enable new levels of creativity and creation than existed ever before.

An example he gave was a Chinese woman he worked with who, despite having never written code in her life, used GPT-4 to create a website in china that has over a million active users in just one weekend. If everyone has tools better than that, than the barrier to entry in countless things evaporate. Think literally all of R&D for biotech, material engineering, etc., and how it can be completely revolutionized by AI.

As to AI art ethics? I got the 'I'm a tech guy, I don't care about art much' response. He didn't think it was important. ""Humans can do things that AI just can't in art, and until the day where that's not true- and I have no idea when that may happen- art is never really going away."" I followed with questions about his opinion on the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, he said something along the lines of, ""fighting the change is cool, but they're inevitably going to lose. They can't stop the march of progress. They will be replaced, and they will find other jobs."" In his opinion, the actions of these unions and people that are trying to fight against AI taking jobs is ultimately meaningless. AI is too useful, and will be too ubiquitous. He didn't even fear the response from neo-luddites when I brought up other possible movements that may resist an AI revolution.

The next moments of the conversation went something like this:

 ""Every time new technology comes out, people cry about the world ending. It happened with calculators! Calculators! In the end, just like every other time in history, all the jobs that get replaced will be forgotten and people will take other more useful positions."" 

""Like prompt engineers?""

""Yes! That's probably what will replace a lot of these writers and actors. Just one or two of them working to manipulate the AI into creating the best possible product. Who could have predicted something like prompt engineering being a real job just 6 months ago? Now we pay people insane amounts of money to do that. People will eventually embrace the change.""

Next came the big question. AGI/Singularity when? He said limited self-learning AI could happen very soon, possibly even before 2030. He was also optimistic about possible AGI. ""The human brain does like 10\^18 calculations per second, and Nvidia has gotten as high as 10\^30."" He seemed to think that true general intelligence was pretty much inevitable, if for no other reason than the amount of money, infrastructure and man-hours being thrown into it's development. The technology is plausible, the idea makes sense. The only issue, is ""no one knows how these AI work. If they say they do, they're lying. That makes it impossible to make any real predictions."" That becomes kind of the crux of the issue. If we don't really know how AI works, how can we know how to make an AGI, or recognize it if we made it? And, since it's theoretical magnitude is so great, how could be control it safely? This brought us back to the cloning solution, but the conversation moved on.

Finally, he had some things to say about what needs to happen in order to make sure that AI is shaped into the effective tool for humanities benefit that it could be. ""Governments have probably about 10 years to figure out how they're going to handle this. Unfortunately, government and policy moves really slow, and that just isn't going to work with AI, especially because of how fast it's developing. If we don't get a handle on it it's going to cause a lot of problems, but we're trying to help figure out a solution. My colleagues and I have been working with..."" (They listed a bunch of different very official sounding organizations that included thinktanks, government agencies all over the globe, researchers, other industry collaborators/competitors, and more.) ""...to try and figure out how we're going to make things work. We understand the risks, and are trying to address them. 

So all in all, the outlook from this industry insider/professional was extremely positive! They predict good long term prospects which is nice, and already key industry figures are taking important steps to both self-regulate, handle ethical issues, and work with governments while also not abandoning the potential of AI technology to revolutionize our way of life.

Also, as a final request, you can almost certainly sleuth out the actual identity of the person I talked to. Don't. And *especially* don't bother them. They were extremely open and kind, and I don't want to accidentally create an annoyance. Thanks in advance!",408,178,1691912122,
Are you ready for AI to take your job away?,"Dito sa US, it feels like AI is everywhere. As in parang every conversation na lang, lalo na sa work, nakakabit ang AI. I will compare it to when the internet first arrived in our lives. But AI's impact is even bigger. This got me thinking: are freelancers in the Philippines feeling this AI wave just as strongly?

Side comment: Do you still remember when we used to have: photo developers, telephone operators and video store rental suki? haha, those jobs are obsolete dahil sa internet!!

A few weeks ago, I hosted a free webinar on how to AI-proof your VA career. Pero, out of over 60 people who registered, only 16 showed up. So it made me wonder: do freelancers there already know how AI is changing the VA game, or are they still in the dark?

AI is changing the VA job market in a big, big way. So many tasks are being automated. Apple is about to launch iPhone with chatGPT integrated in it. That's a big game changer. Tapos, not only are more people transitioning to freelancing, but since AI is starting to replace some of the tasks VAs used to do, nababawasan ang VA roles na naka-post. Personal observation and assumption: Employers are even asking for video applications now. Why? Kasi AI can now write impressive applications for you, but it can't replicate your verbal skills and presence on camera. So it is one filter na agan na legit ang skills mo.

For context - by day, I am an Exec Asst in a financial institution sa NYC and I am supporting a CIO. So pwede din na dahil exposed ako sa tech everyday, ito ang feeling ko. I am also a professional career coach so I try to be aware of trends.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Are you noticing these changes? How is AI impacting your work as a freelancer? Can you share your experiences or do you have tips on how to stay ahead of AI?

What happens when the common man can't find a job?,"I consider myself a libertarian and free market capitalist. I have a good friend who is 30 years my senior and is a socialist. We have breakfast every couple of weeks for hours and discuss a variety of subjects. 

He brought up a good point I can't seem to get around. If AI and robots take off as is expected and all non-skilled jobs and even a large number of skilled jobs are no longer available to humans then is capitalism even still fair?

Some people are limited in their ability, today you could argue they can dig ditches, flip burgers, etc. But what if they can't because it's all been automated? What if the minimum skill required to make it is simply beyond some people's ability?

I'm still not a socialist but if there's no entry level left how can you improve and move up? Do we tax machines and redistribute the wealth? This seems counter to everything libertarian. But letting good people who would happily work but lack the specific skillset and ability to aquire the skillset to find work starve isn't libertarian either.

So please give me the best counters to this point.",261,265,1690686655,
Layoffs and firing will continue ,"Layoffs and firing will continue, with the power of o1 and o3 on the horizon. Jobs are changing. Is o1 or o3 taking your job? No. But a worker who is efficient at using o1 or o3 can do the job of 3 people easily. The job market is going to shift dramatically. My prediction is we are going to see a massive amount of small businesses as running your own business will be so much easier as well. Using o3 a business owner could have it write their contracts, handle their billing, manage their emails, automatically setup accounts, do standard marketing in a fraction of the time. I'm not hypothesizing, I'm literally doing exactly that with our small team. We all have gotten to get great pay increases because we can all do much more. I have AI managing my emails, creating tasks, onboarding is automated and personal. 

Bigger companies will be slower to adopt but we already see it happening. Call centers may outsource but most won't because you can have really good AI bots provide customer support that actually answers questions and reduce your need for the call center. We are in the age of AI and it will be causing massive job shifts as individuals who adopt it in their everyday lives and work will out perform people who don't. You don't have to be a developer, you just have to understand how to use it and how to write prompts. 

I recently used it to organize into a checklist everything to remodel my bathroom from the current status it is, something that took me hours to put together last year took 2 minutes this time and was better and more accurate than I did before. All industries will experience some sort of efficiency that can be gained from using ai. Construction workers included and trades will be included. I used it successfully for organizing cooking for the holidays, when to cook what by feeding it the recipes. I've written proposals that are amazing using the 70 page transcripts from the calls I have with leads because it can handle that much data easily. 

It's not just openai, a lot of ai will be available but I'm most familiar with that as I use it on a daily basis many times. Life has gotten easier for me by learning when and how much I can use it to make so many things quicker to do.

I encourage everyone to use the latest and greatest models as many of the free ones are sub par but there are certainly some that are amazing. Fact is even at $200/month that's 1.5 hours the cost of one employee a month. It saves that one employee 5-20 hours monthly depending on which employee.

"Company, That I am leaving, says Python has been determined to not be an enterprise solution for data movements and application use.","I?檓 glad I?檓 leaving this place. My new role offers better pay, full remote work, and an actual infrastructure to grow in. Still, I have mixed feelings?攍argely because of my boss, who I respect deeply. He?檚 one of the few reasons I regret leaving.

During my two weeks' notice, my boss and I are working hard to ensure the processes I implemented continue to run smoothly and that he fully understands what they do. We?檙e also migrating these processes to a new instance of SQL Server. This involves coordinating with BTS to ensure our team's SQL Server account for automation is properly transitioned and given the required permissions on the new instance.

# The Processes I Built

Over my time here, I?檝e developed a variety of Python scripts that automated critical workflows. Here?檚 a glimpse of what they do:

* **Shipping Invoices:** Interacting with SFTP servers to download invoices.
* **API Integrations:** Connecting with third-party APIs like UPS, USPS, ObserveAI (call transcription), and Salesforce to integrate data for reporting and analytics used by sales and customer service teams.
* **Regression Models:** Running regression analysis to estimate the likelihood of quotes converting into orders. (It?檚 not perfect, but it?檚 pretty effective.)
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Using the transcripts from ObserveAI, I run a sentiment analysis to flag very negative calls. I am hesitant to fully automate this one because I envisioned it being used to help a customer service rep who is getting absolutely berated on the phone, but I don't trust that it won't be used as a way to punish the customer service reps for a customer's undue, but inevitable, verbal tirade.
* **Subscription Management:** Automating tasks like identifying subscriptions on hold for over two months, formatting them into an Excel that was fitted with a Winshuttle script set up to alter holds to cancels, and emailing the file to the subscription service manager for one-click updates in SAP. He and his team had to go through holds one by one before this was written.
* **Marketing Data Uploads:** Daily scripts to upload required data to a marketing analytics service?檚 S3 bucket (Measured).
* **Custom Web App:** I even built an internal web app to replace Excel-based workflows for tasks requiring manual inputs. For instance:
   * Inputting monthly sales quotas or granting quota relief.
   * Managing temporary employee records, which, for some bizarre reason, don?檛 fully appear in SAP.
   * Editing employee names when errors occur, such as formatting issues (e.g., double spaces) or changes due to marriage.
   * Labeling employees as sales or customer service for reporting.

These Python-powered workflows have significantly improved efficiency, saved time, and provided better historical tracking. They never even had ANY way to track how long it took for a package to arrive to a customer!

# Then, That Email

>Thank you Patrick. (my boss)

>While Python has been determined to not be an enterprise solution for data movements and application use, we will allow its use for this at this time. Once we determine the overall strategy going forward this may be revisited. I will have Karen work to get the appropriate level of permissions in place to support the initiative.

I am glad to be leaving, and I feel sorry for the person who is going to replace me. I was excited while helping my boss come up with a better job description and inter-view questions. Now I just feel sorry for the potential replacement in this shit-show.

My last day is Dec. 23rd. What if anything can be done to help out my boss and future replacement? Or do you think they are just out of luck and need to pivot to something else? If it is relevant my boss is an analyst and only knows SQL and powershell, but knows them very well.

  
\-Edit

I guess i really need to clarify because a lot of you seem to think my boss is the one who sent the email. He was the one the email is addressed to. ""Thank you Patrick."" Was the first line of the email. I added tge ""my boss"" to show who was being addressed.",157,79,1734366433,

CMV: A pause on immigration should be wanted by the majority of the population and should be seen as an opportunity to create an actual Living Wage.,"Simply put, if corporations, factories, or farmers are unable to find cheap labor by using immigrants, then they would be forced to increase the wages and salaries workers.
Yes, this might cause prices of items and products to increase, however, if people did not buy these products or items, then the price would have to decrease and the cost of paying higher salaries would be taken from the companies profits and not be paid for by the consumer.


Also I just read this post about 'Mass deportations would disrupt the food chain' https://www.reddit.com/r/California/s/qVLdQKLoVqy and I?檓 confused as to how. I mean, I understand *how* this could potentially disrupt the food chain or food distribution, however, these are billion or million dollar industries. Surely they wouldn?檛 want to lose money by slowing down production, and surely there?檚 high school graduates, 20 something?檚, and 30 something that need money and direction in their lives that would accept these jobs and flourish. I mean, working on a farm beats joining the army, or getting a dead end job at the local piggily wiggling. Australia has Fly in Fly out jobs where many people will work 2 weeks on 1 week off, in a mining town or on a ship and it?檚 enough money to save and move on in a year?? Or, they simply settle down in that town.  How much are these farm workers getting paid, can affordable housing be provided, and can other citizens be given the opportunity to pick cherries and oranges for and livable wage? Why would immigration disrupt a whole industry??that doesn?檛 make sense. Fly people out and advertise appealing opportunities throughout the country??
My point is, I?檓 not sure how much immigrants are getting paid, if it under the table or if it?檚 legitimately on the books, but in California an employer must pay a Minimum Wage and maintain healthy working conditions?? If the cheap labor market dries up, then wages and benefits would have to increase because Walmart, Kroger, and Nestle still want to make their money and if they start charging $10 for a loaf of bread or cereal and no one buys it??then their billion dollar profit margins would be affected, not the consumer,; and the middle class can actually fight, protest, and demand a living wage by having more skin in the game or more leverage.

Am I wrong? 

I mean the flip side would be for corporations to make a quicker move towards robotics and ai automation?? But still, immigration would slow that change, and taxes being paid for by legal workers would be the main benefit.

[See only Dev Replies](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-271-ready-fight.1546912/?prdxDevPosts=1)

[written by Eladrin](https://preview.redd.it/9x2esy75kht91.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5fb552fc5218f75087c45bc3ed6fc042f338a75)

Hello again!

This week?檚 topic is the combat rebalancing planned for the Stellaris 3.6 ?淥rion??update. We?檒l begin with an exploration of the goals and intended scope of the changes, and then go into detail regarding what we?檝e done.

# Scope and Intentions

We first discussed the combat balancing back in [Dev Diary #257](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-257-summer-is-coming.1530184/), and then provided some more information on our early work at PDXCon. Since then, we?檝e done more experimentation and gathered some feedback before making more iterative changes.

When we started thinking about doing the Combat Rebalancing experiment, we had to decide what it was, and perhaps just as importantly, what it was not.

# Goals

We decided that the primary goals were to:

* Shake up the meta and improve general space combat, while maintaining a limited scope.
* Provide benefits to having mixed fleets rather than unihull.
* Using the 3D Assets that we have, improve counterplay and ship design options.

Containing the scope of these changes was considered critical - this is intended to be tightly focused on fleet composition and balance changes rather than a massive rewrite of how fleet combat works. We?檙e also not touching ground combat at this time.

# Problems

Some of the problems that we identified with fleet combat in Stellaris included:

* ?淎lpha strike??artillery battleships dominate the late game. We added a bit of rock-paper-scissors when we improved Strike Craft, but due to the way repeatable technologies interact with combat, eventually all that matters is who has longer range.
* Disengagement mechanics further encourage overkill.
* Ships like Destroyers and Cruisers fall out of effectiveness almost immediately. The Point Defense niche of Destroyers isn?檛 very valuable, and almost anything a Cruiser can do, a Battleship can do better.
* Command Limits don?檛 really do their intended jobs.
* Doomstacks aren?檛 fun.

The last two were deemed out of scope for this round of changes, and will be explored in future updates. We?檙e also not really touching repeatable technologies at this time, focusing instead on trying to provide useful roles for more ship sizes.

# So What Did You Do?

The biggest changes include:

* Ship Roles can now be selected to auto-design ships that actually fulfill certain roles, such as Artillery, Brawler, Torpedo, and so on. If you do not possess any weapons that fulfill the selected role, it?檒l do its best with what you have.
* Torpedoes and select other weapons now gain a multiplicative damage bonus based on the size of the target.
* Missiles have been moved out of the G slot back into S and M.
* Energy Torpedoes such as Proton and Neutron Launchers have been changed into G class weapons with a minimum range. Damage has been adjusted to be balanced as a Torpedo class weapon, and like the new Torpedoes, they deal increased damage to larger targets. Unlike standard torpedoes, they remain instant hit weapons for now.
* A new ship size called the Frigate, an advanced Corvette frame that delivers torpedoes, but is slower and less evasive. It's unlocked with the Torpedo technology.
* Added a minimum range to all Large weapons except Lasers
* Note: Currently ships do not yet back off if all weapons are unable to fire due to range.
* Strike Craft no longer intercept missiles, but will continue to fight each other.
* Flak Batteries now more strongly counter Strike Craft, while Point Defense now more strongly counter missiles and torpedoes. Strike Craft are more reliant on Shields, Missiles and Torpedoes are more reliant on Armor. Due to their ability to bypass shields, Strike Craft are very effective against other Strike Craft.
* Ship combat computers now ignore certain weapons for desired range purposes, and base their desired distance on the actual loadout of the ship. ""Swarm"" and ""Torpedo"" behavior will charge in, ""Picket"" and ""Line"" behaviors will attempt to stay at the range of their median range weapons, and ""Artillery"" and ""Carrier"" will try to stay at the range of their longest ranged weapons.This generally increases the desire for ships to remain at range if possible.
* Ships now get a limited number of Disengagement Opportunities per combat. All current drives provide 1 disengagement roll (except for Psi Jump Drives, which provide 2) once the ship takes hull damage below its disengagement threshold, and the Hit and Run war doctrine grants all of your ships an additional attempt. Civilian ships set to evasive will continue to try to disengage with each hit.
* Some sources of Evasion have been replaced with other effects.
* Everything else changed. Everything we know is wrong. Panic, and know despair.

*Freake's Note: A complete changelog can be found at the end of this post, in an effort to keep this DD at least somewhat readable, while also catering to those of you who might be reading this at work and your work internet blocks the Paradox forums. Your cellphone data plan can thank me later. :D*

# TLDR; ELI5

The roles for different ship sizes should become more valuable. The introduction of size based damage make Frigates and Cruisers potentially very dangerous to Battleships and other large ships.

Frigates, however, are very vulnerable without a screen of Corvettes to protect them, Destroyers are the masters of Point Defense in Screen or cutting down those Corvettes and Frigates using the Gunship or Brawler roles.

Artillery ships are vulnerable if something closes under the range of their guns, but with a screen that engages the enemy further away, they are free to blast away.

Every ship role has a counter somewhere in the system, and mixed fleets that cover for deficiencies are thus generally much more difficult to hard-counter.

As this build is still in ?渉ot??and in development, expect to see many placeholder icons and TODO text here and there. Numbers are not necessarily final, and we?檒l be looking at data gathered from the Open Beta to potentially make additional changes.

Known Issues:

* Many placeholder icons and some placeholder text.
* All new text will only be in English for the duration of the Open Beta.
* Ships do not currently back away if they are trapped within the minimum range of their weapons.

We expect to be making more changes and plan to update the beta at least once during the upcoming weeks.

Targeted feedback threads exist for the following topics:

# 3.6.0 Open Beta Patch Notes:

*Note: 3.6.0 patch notes are also to be considered ?渋n Beta?? as they have not undergone the full review normally done before posting. This is hot stuff.*

*3.5.3 patch notes have also been included in the following list.*

*This includes (most of the) changes from 3.5.3 and 3.6.0 (beta) as of Oct 10, 2022 14:56:52 +0200*

*Consider this changelog to be a beta as they have not undergone the full review we normally do before posting them.*

**Combat Rebalancing**

* Ship Roles can now be selected to auto-design ships that actually fulfill certain roles, such as Artillery, Brawler, Torpedo, and so on. If you do not possess any weapons that fulfill the selected role, it?檒l do its best with what you have.
* Added a new ship size: Frigates are an advanced form of Corvette specialized in delivering G class weapons.
* Torpedoes now gain a multiplicative damage bonus to their damage based on the ship size of the target, as do Prethoryn missiles. The Unbidden also get a reduced variant of this.
* Torpedoes now have a maximum firing arc of 25 degrees.
* Energy Torpedoes such as Proton and Neutron Launchers have been changed into G class weapons with a minimum range. Damage has been adjusted to be balanced as a Torpedo class weapon, and like the new Torpedoes, they deal increased damage to larger targets. Unlike standard torpedoes, they remain instant hit weapons for now.
* Some sources of Evasion have been replaced with other effects.
* Small weapons of a category now have a slightly faster refire rate, Large weapons of a category now have a slightly slower refire rate.
* Added a minimum range to all Large weapons except Lasers
* Ship combat computers now ignore certain weapons for desired range purposes, and base their desired distance on the actual loadout of the ship. ""Swarm"" and ""Torpedo"" behavior will charge in, ""Picket"" and ""Line"" behaviors will attempt to stay at the range of their median range weapons, and ""Artillery"" and ""Carrier"" will try to stay at the range of their longest ranged weapons.This generally increases the desire for ships to remain at range if possible.
* Strike Craft no longer intercept missiles, but will continue to fight each other.
* Flak Batteries now more strongly counter Strike Craft, while Point Defense now more strongly counter missiles and torpedoes. Strike Craft are more reliant on Shields, Missiles and Torpedoes are more reliant on Armor. Due to their ability to bypass shields, Strike Craft are very effective against other Strike Craft.
* Added Armor Hardening and Shield Hardening modifiers, which reduce armor and shield penetration. Added new aux components that use Living Metal or Zro to provide late game armor and shield hardening.
* The Destroyer (Interceptor), Cruiser (Gunship), and Battleship (Broadside) stern sections now have an extra Aux slot.
* Autocannons now have a faster fire rate (and thus are very high damage for their weapon size, but have very short range).
* Added Medium and Large Autocannons
* Added nanite autocannons and flak cannons as a reward for killing the scavenger bot.
* Disruptors and Autocannons  are now considered Brawling weapons, with short range but faster attacks.
* Ships now get a limited number of disengagement opportunities. All current drives provide 1 disengagement roll once the ship takes hull damage below its disengagement threshold, and the Hit and Run war doctrine grants all of your ships an additional attempt. Civilian ships set to evasive will continue to try to disengage with each hit.
* The Enigmatic Encoder now proves +1 Disengagement Opportunity rather than evasion.
* Weapon component tooltips now display minimum range and firing arc.
* Armor components now grant twice as much armor as before. Shield components now grant +50% more than before, but regen remains the same. Hull components grant less than before.
* Hull Technologies now give 10% hull instead
* Armor and Hull regen now behave like shields - five times faster outside of combat. (Regen values are now 20% of the previous values for most components.)
* Defense Platforms no longer have G-slot ship sections.
* Missiles now fit into S weapon slots and have had their damage modified accordingly, Swarmer Missiles go into M. Torpedoes (and Neutron Launchers) are now the only weapons that fit into the G slot.
* Adjusted the maximum range of all non-torpedo missiles. Reduces the range of torpedoes.
* Made XL weapons more likely to target battleships and titans
* Massively increased the chances to lose or damage ships when a fleet uses emergency FTL to escape a battle.
* Reduced the time before emergency FTL can be initiated during combat.
* Ships now attempt to disengage at 25% hull.
* Ships should try to spread out a little further away from one another in combat.
* It is no longer possible to kill a dragon by distracting it with a large fleet of transport ships
* The cap to the Force Disparity bonus for fleets that are significantly outnumbered has been dramatically increased.

**Feature**

* Added an archaeology site in a new solar system with a debris belt
* Added Ascensionists civic for regular empires and equivalents for hives and machines. Provides +25% planetary ascension effects and -10% costs
* Added Holy Covenant Federation type and Conclave Federation Election type
* Added the Cordyceptic Drones civic to hiveminds allowing them to reanimate all organic space fauna.
* Added various new galaxy shapes, such as 3 and 6 arm spirals, and some more experimental and irregular shapes
* Galaxies now default to Spiral (2-Armed) rather than Elliptical. Tiny Galaxies now support Spiral (2-Armed) galaxies.
* Added a new tradition tree (Politics) to the Federations DLC, which requires the Galactic Community to exist. These traditions empower those that are active in the galactic community, including giving Council members new resolution options to propose.
* Reworked the Ascension Paths from Utopia. Instead of requiring two ascension perks to be taken, each Ascension Path is now a tradition tree unlocked by an ascension perk. The Synthetic path is now split into two paths, Cybernetics and Synthetics.

**General Improvements**

3.5.3:

* You will no longer get alerts about envoys dying
* AI will now research debris.

3.6.0:

* The habitability planet icons in the system view can now be clicked just like on the galaxy map.
* Added ""planet revolt"" VO to planetary revolt situation
* Added a Planet Automation setting which allows for construction even during resource deficits
* Rolled Slave Revolt content into the general Separatist Revolt Situation as a variety when slaves try to revolt
* Changed how Planet Automation is presented in the Planet View to more clearly show that there are settings that the player can use
* Planet Automation Crime Management will now forbid enforcer jobs if you have 0 crimes and allow enforcer jobs if you have more than 27 crime
* The tooltip for planetary automation designation setting now explains when it will create new jobs

**Balance**

3.5.3:

* Shared Burden now doubles the unity gained from the egalitarian faction
* Ensured consistency in the Toxic God starting resources: the home system will now always contain a +3 alloys deposit. A nearby one will contain another +2 and a further +6 energy.
* Federation subjects that cannot vote can no longer persuade federation members that someone should not be invited into a federation
* Capped Noxious happiness bonus at 40%
* Vassals that leave an overlord's war by a change in the agreement will now get a truce with every opponent.

3.6.0:

* The fixable segments for the Shattered Ring origin can now be colonised on game start, depending on the Guaranteed Habitable Worlds setting.
* Shattered Ringworlds are no longer ideal worlds, but have a base of 100% habitability.
* Reduced cost and time to restore the Shattered Ringworld by 25%.
* Repairing Shattered Ring Segments now qualify you for the Galactic Wonders AP.
* Colonisable Shattered Ring segments have a large number of blockers including some that require advanced technology to clear, but impact the habitability of the segment.
* Colony designations on ring worlds now provide +10% pop growth and assembly speed (this can be multiplied through planetary ascension). The default ""ring world"" designation provides +15%
* Ecumenopolises now give +25% growth and assembly speed, rather than +50% growth (and no assembly)
* Food Processing Centers, Mineral Purification Hubs, Energy Nexuses, Alloy Nano-Plants, Civilian Repli-Complexes, The Auto-Curating Vault, Citadel of Faith, Corporate Vault and Alpha Hub now have increased cost and upkeep on ringworlds, in exchange for providing the benefits normally giving by their related orbital ring buildings.
* Added an event on game start with Common Ground origin to let you pick your federation type
* Mechanist origin now provides +15% robot assembly speed and +1 robot trait pick (for when you unlock robo-modding)
* The starting robots for the mechanists origin now start with the bulky and high maintenance traits and the matching trait for whichever worker job they hold.
* The Mechanist origin now grants the Robomodding technology as a research option from the start of the game.
* If a species cannot live on a planet, it is now the first to be purged from it (this closes a Clone Army exploit related to slowly purging other species instead)
* It is now allowed for the galaxy to contain multiple void dweller empires
* Artificers now no longer produce engineering research.
* Efficient Bureaucracy now grants Bureaucrats, Priests, Managers and Death Priests with Edict Fund production
* Pearl Divers have had their trade output reduced and their Consumer Goods output increased, with a corresponding increase in food and mineral upkeep.
* Dramatically increased the absolute value of opinion modifiers.
* Increased the opinion modifiers granted from first contact, decreased the base rate at which they decay and made the decay rate modified by improving/harming relations.
* Increased the opinion penalty for undertaking Become the Crisis.
* Maximum opinion from Improve Relations has been increased to 150. Minimum opinion from Harm Relations has been decreased to -150. Previous values were 100 and -100.
* Only xenophobes are now happy if the caravaneers are destroyed.
* Opinion modifiers from Galactic Imperium interactions now have their decay rate affected by improving and harming relations.
* Refactored opinion modifiers from Galactic Imperium.
* Xenophile, pacifist and corporate are upset if the caravaneers are destroyed.
* Capped Federation Experience at 2000 above what is required for level 5, so that level 5 federations with AIs are no longer one of the most fragile configurations known to man
* Increased the time it takes to do first contact with other civilisations by about 30%
* Logic Engines trait is now allowed on droids.
* The Aquatic trait now costs 2 points.
* Imperialist and Supremacist factions will now be pleased forever if you defeat a Leviathan, not just for 20 years. They are also a bit less selective about which Leviathans they are pleased about you killing (i.e. the list has been updated for those added since Leviathans DLC)
* Reduced governing ethics attraction of newly-conquered pops
* Several factions now care about the type of federation you are in, if it is one attached to a particular ethic
* Subjects that are not disloyal will now gain ethics attraction corresponding to their overlord's ethics (this was already the case for spiritualism, now it is the case for all ethics)
* The imperialist faction will now care about how much of your fleet power you are using
* A large number of tweaks to the ethic assignment weights. Includes making certain weights based on diplomacy with empires of a particular ethos have an impact that is more dependent on the number of empires you are engaged in such diplomacy with. Fixed some oddities that hampered authoritarianism, e.g. now relations with authoritarian empires boosts authoritarianism, and if you are authoritarian, it will no longer boost egalitarianism for you to give your pops good living standards. Finally, also added some weights based on the job the pop is actively working (e.g. priests, nobles and soldiers)
* Occupied planets no longer produce or consume resources from buildings or pops
* Rebalanced Harmony, Prosperity, Mercantile, Versatility and Adaptability traditions.
* Slightly increased the chance of having a unique first contact event chain
* Special endgame crisis factions such at the Aberrant, Cybrex and Sentinels now show up a bit earlier on large galaxy maps

* Splinter Hive holdings now require at least 30 pops present on the subject planet to be constructed.
* Tweaked Galactic Market location formula to far more strongly favour trade value in its criteria
* You can now once again apply species templates that would remove beneficial traits, so long as you were able to make the template as a valid combination in the first place
* Zro distillation technology no longer explicitly requires Psionic Theory, but is extremely rare without it.
* Chemical Bliss no longer states that it causes unemployed pops to produce unity.
* The \[REDACTED\] now has an acidic gland dealing 1.25% hull damage per day to all ships in the same system. This does not apply to the player controlled variant.

**Performance and Stability**

* Further improved the performance of using triggered economic category modifiers
* Made mean time to happen events early out if they have fire\_only\_once and have already fired. (I.e. they will stop draining performance once no longer relevant)
* Opening the fleet manager in the late game will now have a much-reduced impact on frame rate
* Slightly sped up the calculation of pop job weights when updating them from serial (i.e. not during the monthly batch parallel update)
* Fixed a rare crash caused by invalid trade routes
* Fixed rare crash related to invalid situation or triggered modifier target.
* Fixed rare crash related to invalid situation while updating country modifiers

**UI**

* Added a more helpful tooltip to the Inter-Dimensional Trade modifiers
* Added a tooltip for war demand achievement acceptance that lists systems you lack claims on.
* Added modifier details to production and upkeep of buildings
* Added modifier details to production and upkeep of districts
* Added tooltips for ship roles in ship designer.
* Caravaneers now tell you when you will be allowed to open another Reliquary in the tooltip where they say they can't offer one right now as they need more time to prepare.
* First Contact event chains will now progress if there is a purely random event with only one option. (Note that this only covers events between stages, not the ones that end stages, which may also only have one option). You can tell if your first contact chain is not blocked by a pending event because the alert icon will look a bit less threatening.
* Fixed megastructure outliner right click not focusing on the megastructure (as is standard for other outliner objects)
* Fixed misleading tooltip for why an AI will say no to your request to join their federation (it suggested they did not want to be a federation partner with a current member, but actually it meant that that member did not want to be a federation partner with you)
* Fixed the tooltip for commercial pacts showing the wrong value for how much you would benefit in terms of trade income
* Reduced notification spam from empires having certain CBs on you
* Selecting fleets from the galaxy map will now no longer select fleets merging with larger ones - so you can select all the large fleets in a system and move them somewhere without disrupting all the single ship fleets that are on their way to merge with them
* The subject will no longer be able to press the ""Build Holdings"" button in the agreement view.
* Tooltips regarding offering or receiving Federation Association status now explain that this is basically a non-aggression pact

**AI**

3.5.3:

* Increased the monthly random chance that an AI will decide to start preparing for war.
* AI empires will now bring their assault armies towards the enemy during war preparation phase.
* Reduced the maximum AI war preparation period from 60 months to 30 months.
* Fixed an issue where AI would use their ""prepare for war"" gather logic even during an ongoing war.
* Fixed an issue where the AI would try and gather their fleets for an upcoming war in a system which they could not access.
* Fixed AI sometimes not hiring enough scientists to keep researching.
* Fixed some cases where AI would inexplicably spam admirals.
* AI hive-mind will no longer destroy hive warrens.
* Fixed AI not allocating at least the desired\_min to its budgets. Double-allocating resources is less risky than having it not be respected, as with the Influence budget there's a fair chance that the desired minimum may never be hit
* Improved AI's early game alloy expenditure (it wanted to put a lot into buildings)
* Xenophile empires are now more likely to build trading hub type starbases, changed from materialists.
* Fixed issues with starbase module logic which made AI forbidden from building anything on certain starbases.
* Fixed an issue where AI fleets would get stuck in a loop of resetting their move orders during hyperlane windup time.
* Fixed an issue where AI empires were not allowed to downgrade shipyard type starbases if they had an ongoing construction of ships which made AI empires have much more shipyards than intended.
* Fixed an issue where bombarding AI fleets would get stuck in a loop of flying between the starbase in the system and orbiting the bombardment target when they were waiting for assault armies to invade their bombardment target planet.
* Added additional logic for AI to merge fleets which are close to each other during wars to reduce the amount of small AI fleets.
* Fixed an issue where AI empires would incorrectly try and merge their assault armies together by using FTL reinforcement mechanic, causing their ground troops to be indefinitely stuck in MIA mode.
* Fixed several issues with AI regrouping logic where fleets would suicide one by one instead of grouping up together before attacking.
* AI empires who do not use food will no longer build hydroponics on starbases

3.6.0:

* AI will not get stuck trying to activate tradition trees it was blocked out from activating, like the ascension perk trees. (This previously mainly affected modded games)
* AI will now correctly avoid superior enemy forces when pathing to link up with fleet group
* Fix an issue where the Prethoryn Scourge did not get all AI updates it should
* Fixed AI sometimes not hiring enough scientists to keep researching
* Fixed an issue where AI would sometimes build strongholds even though their economy plan for navy cap was not activated
* Fixed another issue where AI fleets would get stuck in a loop of resetting their move orders during hyperlane windup time

"Organized labor drama on r/Canadapost as strikers, scabs, concerned citizens, and bootlickers debate how much post workers should make","Source: [Average salary is already above $27. Hospital lab technicians make 29 if they are lucky. Why the hell do you think you are entitled to $35+ an hour for working 3 hours, with the most vacation time and amazing benefits. It's unskilled labour. Then you are trying to make it so machines and AI can't do the work. Why? It's so unskilled a robot can do it. At one point realize your worth. Go back to school if you want more. Lazy.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1hc2jk9/you_work_an_unskilled_job_making_as_much_as_a/?sort=controversial)

**HIGHLIGHTS**

* [When I started as a registered nurse in 2018 I was making 32.20$/h and still don?檛 make much more than that lmfao.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1hc2jk9/you_work_an_unskilled_job_making_as_much_as_a/m1l2q3r/)

   * The union for nurses is fighting ahs for a huge increase right now, too. That being said, nurses are more valuable than postal workers. You also can justify a wage increase as a return on your investment in yourself for paying for nursing school and busting your ass to get your certifications. Your job can be a million times more stressful as well. You have to deal with everything under the sun from bodily fluids to death and grieving family members.

       * And in MB MNU is saying they won?檛 be getting increases

          * Why don't we give nurses AND postal workers a raise? ...Why don't we give ALL working class people a raise?  Why are you all fighting against your own interests?  Postal workers make on average $40K a year... there is no possible way they are in danger of being greedy with an income like that... They could ask for twice as much and still wouldn't be anything more than middle class.

         * Looks like the ""us vs them"" rhetoric is alive and well. It doesn't matter who is more important. What matters is that everyone deserves a living wage.

             * You have a better starting and median wage for unskilled labor than damn near anyone else out there, not to mention better benefits and holidays than I've ever heard of for unskilled labor

             * Do u think ruining your body is worth nothing?

             * Ever heard of living within your means? 

       * Nurses are more valuable than postal workers? If postal workers aren't important... why is everyone losing their mind about not getting their mail right now?

              * Nurses are 100x more important. You are not a serious person if you?檙e really asking that. 

                      * It?檚 more nuanced than that. Yes objectively a nurse is more important than a postal work. But we also need the postal worker to deliver medical supplies. Postal work is considered an essential service for a reason.  The fact that you, a non postal worker, is on this sub commenting a test to the fact as to why they are so important. No job is more important than another. As a society we need all of them to function. Hence why everyone, including you, is loosing their marbles right nowb 

   * So instead of fighting for better pay... we should just stop other working people from getting more pay??

      * Buddy??they are already overpaid based on the market supply and demand. Lots of people are happy to replace them if not the union.

          * Are they? I see CP hiring all the time so they clearly dont have a lineup.

           * They make less per hour on average then fed ex Purolator and ups. They are under industry standards. If so many people want to work for them, why dont they? Theres not a city in canada that doesnt have multiple job listings any day of the year. From pt temp to managerial. The openings seem countless. There must be a reason for that

               * There is. Nobody stays. My daughters ex boyfriend was a casual and quit shortly after. He thought Canada Post was his dream job. It wasn?檛.

       * They are already overpaid and want to kill 55000 canadian jobs because they're so entitled they think they deserve even more.

          * I fucking hate!!! These type of comment ?檮 what is your profession? Education? Social background? Be honest

               * These people are short sighted and are never directly affected. 

          * Automation tech :) 

               * Alright..I would love to know your story, background, education to think that we should just throw all of these job away wihtoit having a solution to make those people have decent life...you want a world of AI/robot that the only people surviving would be the mega millionaires/billionaires




* [I think the problem here is that you undervalue your position. So does your employer. Dont you think in the health industry you should make more? Your job certainly is more important but dont hate on CP because theyre doing exceptionally well at negotiating their wages over the years. Reflect on it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1hc2jk9/you_work_an_unskilled_job_making_as_much_as_a/m1kxm00/)

   * Not a health tech my mom is. And no. If everyone made more then everything would cost more. 

       * Not if the rich had less wealth

       * This is a lie sold to you by the rich. Everyone could make more money and wealth-havers could do without making more profit this quarter than this quarter last year and it would have absolutely no impact on prices

           * You?檙e being silly. It?檚 not a lie. It?檚 economics

               * There?檚 actually solid evidence that increased wages don?檛 have much of an effect on inflation.

               * So if rich folks gained slightly less extra over time and consequently everyone else had more that would raise prices how exactly? Or are you making the very basic mistake of equating greed with 'economics'?  

      * Lol ?渕ommmm! I?檓 on Reddit again!???槀 absolutely hilarious

          * Yes, laugh at others. Thats shows a lot of the entitled workers and their supporters.

                * I?檒l take the discourse seriously when it doesn?檛 sound like a grade 4 classroom in here. What else is there to do but laugh really?

        * Right??and theyre asking for more because the liberal government inflated everything and now everything costs more?? Now its your moms turn to go to her table and do the same??

            * Lots of things caused inflation, not just one thing. Which is the reason inflation happened across the globe and not only in Canada.

                  * Agreed, but how many policies were passed by left wing parties??both nationally and globally? A lot of governments that have been in power for the last few years were liberal minded. They all had the same game plans and right now the momentum is swinging back to conservative minded.

       * Lol oh no I?橫 not a health tech my mom is, I just stay home all day and play vidya and eat cheetohs and wait for my allowance money from mom. ?ぃ lol

           * and that matters here... how? are there any points in this argument that is made less convincing because op has a mother working in the health industry?

                 * I was just more thinking this is a conversation for adults??but by all means I understand the concern about letters getting to the North Pole. Just remember Santa sees you when you?檙e sleeping and knows when you?檙e awake, so as long as you?檝e been good all year he?檒l understand the delay of correspondence this one year. Actually he told me personally.

* [I have a relative very very high up in CP board. Yes he is very wealthy from bonuses . They are dissolving the entity of Canada Post completely in 3 years max if not sooner this is approved and on the books. Most of these people will be unemployed by 2026. This just was the nail in the coffin they needed to get the ball rolling. The federal Gov is also fully aware and in agreement also. This is why the gov has not done nothing so far to intervene CP has asked them not too. They are just patiently waiting as most citizens will eventually agree with them . The worst idea to refuse to work when a literal monkey can do your job for half the cost. The union has crippled you as anything but whiners, best get back to work and enjoy that last hurrah. Your time is running out.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1hc2jk9/you_work_an_unskilled_job_making_as_much_as_a/m1l9j7m/)

    * So what?檚 the plan, just cancel Canada Post? That won?檛 hurt me personally, but what about people who live up north or in very rural areas?

        * privatize it or get other companies to do it with keeping certain standards. i have 0 issues with not paying 1 billion a year to this company.

           * If you aren?檛 paying Canada post you will be paying the other companies. Rural routes aren?檛 profitable. No shipping company would do it without major subsidies.

    * So you're okay with someone driving a company into the ground to line their own pockets?  Firstly, that's disgusting behaviour and you should feel ashamed for backing that mentality.  Secondly, I highly doubt they would sell off assets to attempt to maintain the business if the goal is to simply drive it into the ground. They wouldn't be putting money into growing and developing the business further.  Third, if what you said IS true and they are purposefully driving the company into bankruptcy and are attempting to use their workforce as an excuse, then you are outing your family member and the rest of the board as criminals. If that is discovered to be their intentional plan, they would face civil and criminal consequences. Purposefully driving a company into bankruptcy is called fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and would result in potentially 14+ years in jail.

        * Who is lining their pockets?? Canada Post has no shareholders it?檚 a crown corporation. The only people losing money are the Canadian people when the government has to bail out their shitty company. If the government did something as simple as take away their monopoly, they would collapse and a much for efficient corporation who can actually turn a profit would take their place.

            * The people on the board make upwards of 400k/year and provided themselves hefty bonuses this year too. Odd thing to do when the company is losing millions.

                 * From what I see only the CEO makes 450 K a year while the board of directors make $150 k a year, 13% more than the average salary of Canada. Seems relatively low for a company. Do you have any sources saying otherwise?

   * Rural af. We don't even have mailboxes in our town  everything either goes to Canada Post P.O Box or porch pirates swipe the packages. What's gonna happen to us when it dissolves?

       * It will just be privatised. The government will handle its own distribution of paper work i.e. passports and tax return type of docs. There are millions of Canadians looking to work. Excellent personal small business to finance a truck and start making triple then delivering for Uber. It will get done. Just as it's getting done now without them. There will be more private drivers than packages to deliver you watch. It would actually be a great thing much faster for all.

           * Doesn't solve the problem that we don't have mailboxes/mail storage in our village or anywhere and theft is rampant since packages have been delivered directly to homes. I think we're about to lose a lot more important mail here 

                * Someone out there is smart enough to get you and your entire town the mail it would happen.

* [Have you seen house prices? How much unskilled work should be worth when shoebox appartments cost 3k+ per month?](https://np.reddit.com/r/CanadaPost/comments/1hc2jk9/you_work_an_unskilled_job_making_as_much_as_a/m1l3yyj/)

    * Not everywhere is rent $3000/month. Just like not every where should pay $20-$30/hour in a federal job. What it costs in ONT/BC isn?檛 the same in MB/Sask etc

* [All the money that would be required for a bailout, should instead go into drones and machines to replace every single employee there.  As far as rural areas go, set up a central drop off for packages, have a drone deliver em.  The cost saving to the tax payer and improvement in service would be incredible.

    * Your taxes don't pay for their salary. It's pathetic that you want these workers replaced by robots when you don't even understand how it works.

       * It will pay for their bailout.

            * Do you think response somehow justifies your previous comment?

                 * 100% yes. We the taxpayer should absolutely not be required to bail out failing companies. This job can be automated, it should be. Everyone laid off from this can claim EI like everyone else and move on with their lives.  Taxpayers bailing out shit companies is a fundamental flaw in our economy. I?檓 sure you?檙e anti Wall Street bailouts, but you support this, maybe ask yourself why.

    * How much income tax do those drones pay?

        * How much income tax is Canada post about to receive in a bailout?  Companies could easily be charged taxes equivalent to employee income tax on using automation like drones. Would save the company money to do so as well. Win win.

   * Yeah, when I was in the service industry I kept seeing posts like this over COVID. People kept saying ""OH MY GOD JUST OPEN THE DOORS, YOU MAKE MINIMUM WAGE, FUCK YOU YOUR JOB IS STUPID BUT I ABSOLUTELY NEED IT RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU DONT DESERVE MORE AND I DONT CARE IF YOU DIE""  Are postal workers worthless, or necessary? Because most people against the strike seem to say they are both, at the same time. Getting $27 an hour, that's been going down with inflation every year still isn't great.  I'm fine with CP workers striking and hope they get more. And that nurses get more. And teaches. And McDonald's workers.

    * I don?檛 understand your point. We aren?檛 really dependent on those unskilled workers, they can be replaced. If they aren?檛 happy with the wage, they can go find a higher paying job for another delivery company right?

      * So cause you don't have more they shouldn't?

          * People should be paid based on their value. We can?檛 afford to pay all government related employees amazing wages that are far beyond market value. I wish we could but its not fair or realistic

So your answer to making more money is to go back to school - but you're noting a Hospital Lab Tech, which requires a post-secondary education, doesn't make very much money.So you're proving that post-secondary education doesn't guarantee good wages. So how is the solution more education?Also, there is no such thing as unskilled labour. Only what our society has deemed ""respectable"" vs ""not respectable"" labour - which is set by people's own misplaced ego. Jobs that we often claim are ""unskilled"" are the jobs we rely on - garbage men, bus drivers, letter carriers, etc., are all necessary for the easier way of life we all enjoy.

   * You're confusing necessary with skilled. Some jobs are completely necessary - garbage men for example, but it doesn't take any particular skill to do the job. Just knowing how to lift a can up and dumping it in the truck. That's pretty much it. You could learn the job in one day.

       * I'm saying that skill isn't a factor in deciding if someone should be paid a liveable wage for doing full-time work. All individuals working full-time work should be paid a living wage - that means making enough money to cover living expenses, such as rent, food, clothes, utilities, transportation, etc.  I'm not conflating skill and necessity. I'm just also not conflating skill with value, worth, or respect.  

   * You?檙e an idiot. Everyone can?檛 be postmen or suddenly they would require you idiots to be educated. 
  Also don?檛 compare these lazy people to garbage men/women. Such an insult. Garbage men/women work more in two days then you guys do in a week.  Also people appreciate when they do their job and do it right. It?檚 not a hard job at all. 

        *  Your assumptions are making you look a little silly.

            * I'm not a postal worker. I have never worked for the postal service.  I don't know any ""lazy"" postal workers. They work hard, carrying 50+lbs of mail, walking 20-30K steps per day in all weather conditions.  Remember when we had flash flooding in Burlington, ON? Postal workers went out in that. Lightning, flooding, high winds, and all. They were there.  I don't disagree that garbage collectors work hard. But do not minimize the hard labour of postal workers either.

                  * The postwomen in my town I've personally seen do not do any trekking or carrying heavy mail. They pull up their vehicle directly beside the community mailbox, sort the letters and packages, then drive off.  We could easily make the same argument for retail workers. They were there during the pandemic and all, helping people get food and goods, but they still get paid minimum wage.

              * Post people are absolutely not carrying that much on them. Stop lying. 

    * Give me a break. You really think putting mail in a box or a garbage bag in a truck is a skill? It?檚 a job but you need no skills to do it.

I applied to 250 jobs and timed how long each one took,"Applying to jobs online is like navigating a maze.

Amidst the special torture that is resume parsing software, the inability to reuse information across different application tracking systems (ATS), and the existence of a certain company that rhymes with every day of the week, it can get pretty frustrating.

I wanted to explore what factors make a job application more or less frustrating.

For example, what industries have the worst application processes? Do big companies ask for more information than small companies? What is it about websites like Workday that make them really hard to use?

To answer these questions, I applied to 250 jobs. One by one. Click by click. No Linkedin Easy Apply, no shortcuts ??just straight from the careers page.

I timed how long it took me to go from ?渁pply to job??to ?渟ubmit application??

Make no mistake: I sacrificed my soul for this post. I created over 83 accounts and spent a total of 11 hours scrolling. I was originally going to do this for 500 companies, but wanted to chop my head off halfway.

I did this for a mix of companies ??Fortune 500 to early stage startups, spread out across different industries from software to manufacturing. The聽*type*聽of role I applied to was kept constant: engineering / product focused.

The outcome? An average of over two and a half minutes per application??62 seconds of your life you'll never get back. But as we dig deeper, you'll discover that these 162 seconds only scratch the surface of an often maddening process.

*Key Takeaways*

* **Average Application Time:**聽On average, it took a bit over two and a half minutes to apply to a job.
* **Company Size Impact:**聽If company size doubles, the application time increases by 5%. If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%.
* **Industry Influence:**聽Being a government company is the single largest determinant of a long application, followed closely by aerospace and consulting firms.
* **Longest Application:**聽The longest application time went to the United States Postal Service (10 minutes and 12 seconds).
* **Shortest Application:**聽On the other hand, It took me just 17 seconds to apply to Renaissance Technologies.
* **ATS Impact:**聽Older ATS like Workday and Taleo make job applications as much as 128% longer.

# The Setup

There?檚 no real method to the 250 companies I pick. I?檓 just typing names into Google and trying to vary it up. Where does Trisha work? What was that billboard I saw? It's all up for grabs.

Here?檚 the distribution of the 250 companies by size:

Some examples of companies in each range:

* 1-500 ??Glean, Quizlet, Gumroad
* 500-5,000 ??Notion, Dolby, Moloco
* 5,000-50,000 ??Airbnb, Genentech, Logitech
* 50,000-100,000 ??HP, American Express, Pfizer
* 100,000+ ??Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, General Motors

# What makes a job application so frustrating

Generally speaking, the more frustrating a job application, the longer it takes to complete.

The three main factors that might influence how long a job application is (as measured in my data):

1. **Company size**聽??I would expect bigger companies to ask more questions.
2. **The ATS that is being used**聽??I would expect clunkier, older ATS to make job applications longer.
3. **Company industry**聽??I would expect more ?渢raditional??industries to ask more questions.

We?檙e going to model the relationship between the above three factors and the amount of time it takes to complete a job application. To do this, we?檙e going to use a technique called linear regression.

Regression is about the way two measurements change together. It can help us make predictions.

For example, if I add 10 employees to a company, how many seconds will that add to the company?檚 job application process?

Since we have other factors like ATS and Industry, we will also account for those. For now, though, let?檚 just focus on each factor one by one.

# Company Size

Let?檚 first plot the data as is:

https://preview.redd.it/bx60351ueryb1.png?width=3276&format=png&auto=webp&s=21e1d8fec3f9a89c1d01d9d3940f0a28f8523ab7

Yes, I know, this isn?檛 the most useful graph. I?檓 going to spruce it up real quick, I promise.

The United States Postal Service has a job application that took over 10 minutes to complete. Navigating their portal felt like using Internet Explorer in 2003:

https://preview.redd.it/zvzdbpyveryb1.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=14df96ba9f10a38388db094a636964a69c97241f

Netflix?檚 application was just 20 seconds - their only mandatory requirements are your resume and basic info.

https://preview.redd.it/vo9qh9uyeryb1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b77e684d5dd19aeb5514a25b831491315aa4f3

Apple took me 71 seconds, still pretty fast for a company that has over 270,000 employees (PWC, which has a similar number of employees, took me almost six times as long).

Okay, back to the chart. There are a couple of problems with it.

First, the data is not linear. This is a problem if we want to use linear regression.

Second, the company size scale is hard to interpret because of the many data points clumped together near zero (representing all the smaller companies).

We can resolve both these issues with the following insight:

There is a big difference between going from 10 to 100 employees and, say, 10,000 to 10,100 employees. The first represents major changes in company structure: you might actually hire a proper HR team, a bunch of recruiters, and build out your candidate experience. The second, though, is pretty much just business as usual - think of a multinational opening up a satellite office or a regular month of hiring.

Since we want to account for this, our data is better suited to a log scale than a linear scale. I will also transform our Y-axis, the application time, to a log scale because it helps normalize the data.

If we plot both our variables on a log-log scale, we get the below chart:

https://preview.redd.it/623kzud1fryb1.png?width=4304&format=png&auto=webp&s=f88ce2fe55154d319827924c4bfc367406eaf6b6

Better right? This is the same data as the last chart, but with different axes that fits the data better, we observe a linear relationship.

We have the usual suspects in the top right: Government organizations, professional services firms, and some of the tech industry dinosaurs.

The variance in application times across smaller companies, like startups, is interesting. For example, many of the startups with longer application times (e.g OpenAI, Posthog, Comma.AI) reference that they are looking for ?渆xceptional??candidates on their careers page. (Note that OpenAI has changed its application since I last analyzed it - it?檚 now much faster, but when I went through they asked for a mini essay on why you?檙e exceptional).

One thing that I was expecting to see was competitors mirroring each other?檚 application times. This is most closely represented with the consulting firms like Deloitte, E&Y, KPMG, etc all clumped together. McKinsey and Bain, the two most prestigious consulting firms, have applications that take longer to complete.

This doesn?檛 necessarily seem to be the case with the FAANG companies.

We can also calculate the correlation coefficient for this graph. This is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. The closer to 1 the value, the stronger the relationship.

For the above data, we get a correlation coefficient of 0.58, which is a moderate to strong association.

Note that on its own, this doesn't tell us anything about causation. But it does start to point us in some type of direction.

It's not rocket science: big companies ask for more stuff. Sometimes they ask for the last 4 digits of your SSN.

https://preview.redd.it/kditrvs3fryb1.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=7253a1efde6d8c520f36085bc996c7fce0622e6d

Sometimes they even ask if you?檇 be okay going through a polygraph:

https://preview.redd.it/cp048u16fryb1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a24b8eca9cfbc69a1952504c937d0980e2c721

An argument here is that if big companies didn?檛 have some sort of barriers in their application process, they?檇 get swarmed with applications.

Consider the fact that Google gets 3 million applications every year. Deloitte gets 2 million. Without some sort of initial friction in the application process, those numbers would be even higher. That friction almost serves as a reliable filter for interest.

If you?檙e an employer, you don?檛 really care about the people using a shotgun approach to apply. You want the candidates that have a real interest in the position. On the other hand, if you?檙e a candidate, the reality is such that the shotgun approach to apply is arguably the most efficient.

So we have this inherent tension between companies and candidates. Candidates want the most bang for their buck, companies don?檛 want thousands of irrelevant resumes.

And in the middle, we have the plethora of application tracking software that can often be quite old and clunky.

# ATS

Everytime I came face to face with a company that used Workday as their ATS, I died a bit inside. This is because Workday makes you:

1. create a new account every single time
2. redirects you away from the careers page

I defined a redirect as one when the job description is not listed on the same page as the first input box part of the application.

This isn?檛 a perfectly accurate measure, but it does allow us to differentiate between the modern ATS like Greenhouse and older ones like Workday.

With every ATS, I implicitly had some type of ?渉ow easy is this going to be??metric in my head.

We can try to represent this ?渉ow easy is this going to be??metric a bit more concretely using the matrix below.

https://preview.redd.it/z76c7qi9fryb1.png?width=2200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c29a7de33681970634f94b10c00e96dfa70297bc

Ideally, you want the ATS to be in the bottom left corner. This creates an experience that is low friction and fast.

If we plot application time versus ATS, this is what we get:

https://preview.redd.it/d3l1fmccfryb1.png?width=3184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29eccad8f9d35228786c1e62e9f8dd93e3d0ecf

The ATS that don?檛 make you create an account and don?檛 redirect you are tied to lower application times than the ones that do.

One possibility is that certain companies are more likely to use certain ATS. Big companies might use Workday for better compliance reporting. Same with the industry - maybe B2C software companies use the newer ATS on the market. These would be confounding variables, meaning that we may misinterpret a relationship between the ATS and the application time when in fact there isn?檛 one (and the real relationship is tied to the industry or size).

So to properly understand whether the ATS actually has an effect on application time, we need to control for our other variables. We?檒l do this in the final section when we run a regression including all our variables.

One of the big frustrations surrounding different ATS is that when you upload your resume, you then need to retype out your experience in the boxes because the ATS resume parser did it incorrectly. For example, I went to UC Berkeley but sometimes got this:

https://preview.redd.it/2a3vcysefryb1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=066c5efb10ff539e56607dc542650c373417954b

The only resume parser that didn't seem abysmal was the one from Smart Recruiters. TikTok's resume parser also isn't bad.

Another frustrating experience is tied to inconsistency between the company I'm applying to and the ATS.

https://preview.redd.it/kbciteygfryb1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c4e286dfe5253402f720e3fb107205ba73665de

A company?檚 application process is often the first touchpoint you have with their brand. Startups competing for the best talent can't afford extra steps in their process. Apple and Facebook can.

Whilst the average time to complete a job application may only be 162 seconds, the fact that many ATS require steps like account creation and authentication can lead to application fatigue.

It?檚 not necessarily the explicit amount of time it takes, it?檚 the steps involved that drain you of energy and make you want to avoid applying to new jobs.

# Industry

Okay, so far we?檝e looked at company size and the ATS as a loose indicator of what might make a job application frustrating. What about the company industry?

You would expect industries like banking or professional services to have longer application times, because getting those jobs revolves around having a bunch of credentials which they likely screen for (and ask you to submit) early on in the process.

On the other hand, internet startups I?檇 expect to be quick and fast. Let?檚 find out if this is true.

https://preview.redd.it/vabl97kkfryb1.png?width=4012&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf16ac56c432c336aaa19787bf26c5af8d106dd7

Hyped up industries like AI and Crypto have shorter application times. As expected, banks and consulting firms care about your GPA and ask you to submit it.

A government company has to basically verify your identity before they can even receive your application, so the process is entirely different and reflected in the submission time.

For many technology companies, the application process is almost like an extension of the company?檚 brand itself. For example, Plaid (an API first Fintech company), has a neat option where you can actually apply to the job via API:

https://preview.redd.it/pi5lsatmfryb1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fc74b8befbd29348eeaa4a0debdef14f13a7ea8

Roblox, a gaming company, allows people to submit job applications from within their [games](https://gamerant.com/roblox-company-interview-job-applicants-in-game/).

We also notice differences between legacy companies and their newer competitors. If we compare legacy banks versus neobanks (like Monzo, Mercury, etc), the legacy players averaged around 250 seconds per job application whereas the neobanks averaged less than 60 seconds.

If you can?檛 compete on prestige, you need to find other ways. One of those ways can be through asking for less information upfront.

# Putting it together

Now that we've analyzed each variable - the company size, ATS, and the industry - to understand the separate relationship of each to application time, we can use linear regression to understand the *combined* relationships.

This will allow us to determine what factors actually have an impact on the job application time versus which ones might just have had one when we looked at them in isolation.

After some number crunching in R, I get the following results (I?檝e only added the statistically significant factors ??the ones with the ?渟trongest evidence??:

https://preview.redd.it/myvjggspfryb1.png?width=2496&format=png&auto=webp&s=18271bd0e3a68aa4f2416837cd9ab0ed8d9a6cc4

Here?檚 how you can interpret some of the information above:

* When a job app is for a company that is within the Government industry, the submission time goes up by 366% (assuming the size and ATS are constant). For the aerospace industry, this is 249% (and so on).
* When a job app is for a company using the Workday ATS, the submission times goes up by 128% (assuming the size and industry are constant). For the Phenom ATS, this is 110% (and so on).
* Our only (statistically significant) metric which seems to make job applications faster is the Lever ATS (42% shorter).

Okay, now what about company size?

Well, first up: company size is indeed statistically significant. So there is an effect.

However, its effect is not as strong as most of our other variables. To be precise, here are some ways to interpret our company size coefficient:

* If company size doubles, the app size increases by 5%
* If company size increases by a factor of 10, then the app time increases by 20%

This is a smaller effect size compared to ATS or industry (a 20% increases in app time for a 10x large company is a qualitatively smaller effect size than e.g. a 100% increase in app time for Taleo ATS). So although company size is statistically significant, it is not as strong of a driver as ATS and industry of app time.

# Wrapping it up

Two and a half minutes might not be too long, but it can feel like an eternity when you?檙e forced to answer the same questions and upload the same documents. Over and over again.

Think about catching a flight. All you want is to get on the jet. Hawaii awaits.

But first: the security line. You have to take your shoes off. You get patted down and your bag gets searched. The gate numbers don?檛 make sense. And then at the end of it, your flight?檚 delayed. Congrats.

Applying to a job can feel similar. All you want to do is say aloha to the hiring manager, a real human being.

To even have the remote possibility of making that happen, you need to create an account and password, check your email, retype your entire resume, tell them the color of your skin, and explain why this company you?檝e never heard of before is the greatest thing on Earth.

And for what? Most likely for the privilege of receiving an automated email about two weeks later rejecting you.

If we make it tiring and unappealing to look for new opportunities, then we prevent people from doing their best work.

But what would a world where applying took just a few seconds actually look like? Recruiters would get bombarded with resumes. It's possible to argue that job applications taking so long is a feature, not a bug. You get to filter for intent and narrow down your application pool.

Is it fair to shift the burden of screening unqualified candidates onto good candidates that now need to provide so much information? Shouldn?檛 that burden fall on the recruiter?

The truth is that applying to a job via the careers page is a bit of a rigged game. The odds are not in your favor.

Sometimes, though, all you need is to only be right once.

Some thoughts on Vivek?檚 tweet,"I?檒l preface by saying that I think the tweet was cringe culture-war/bootstraps/model-minority bullshit, and it was hilarious to see the MAGA infighting that resulted from it. I think the H1B program needs massive changes (minimum salary requirement should be 150-175% of the median full-time worker in the state where the place of work is located, workers should be able to change jobs easily) to eliminate indentured-servitude/body-shop practices.

But I think there?檚 a grain of truth under Vivek?檚 pile of garbage. Why pursue a difficult degree course in science or engineering, when one can pursue a similarly-paying career in sales/finance/consulting with much less effort? And especially, why pursue a PhD or postdoc when the pay and job security are so poor? For the Asian immigrant, it?檚 because these provide good pathways to visas and permanent residency (or, increasingly, valuable foreign experience that bolster?檚 one?檚 case for a high-level position at home). For their US-born children, it provides a solid and objective marketable skill in an environment where DEI, lack of personal connections, and ?渃ulture fit??would otherwise dampen their prospects. *An increase in STEM among the native-born population will only occur when the reward is commensurate with the effort and sacrifices required,* and the ?渃ultural??change will be downstream of that.

In the final analysis though, the precise racial composition of the middle class/labor aristocracy (the subgroup of employees whose income can purchase the labor power of proletarians like waiters, delivery drivers, and cashiers several times over) is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Anecdotally, just looking over tech job listings?攅ven from ?渂ody shops??like Cognizant?攔eveals a large number of intern/associate and senior roles, with full-time entry-level positions hard to find. I attribute this in no small part to AI, which in the long term (I think) will have the same hollowing-out effect on the professional urban middle class that automation had on the industrial middle class of yesteryear. As MLK said about that episode:

> One unfortunate thing about the slogan Black Power is that it gives priority to race precisely at a time when the impact of automation and other forces have made the economic question fundamental for blacks and whites alike. In this context, a slogan ?楶ower for Poor People??would be much more appropriate than the slogan ?楤lack Power??
The contradictions created by the erosion of the professional middle class?攖he possibility of entry into which is a sort of release valve for the pressures created by capitalism??can only be reconciled by improving the conditions of the proletariat proper, into which a larger and larger fraction of the American population will find themselves sorted. Otherwise, we risk rehashing the same right-populist, racial-resentment politics of the 1980s and 90s (and the ?渓eftist??idpol backlash) which only served to transfer an even larger share of wealth to the ruling class.",73,90,1735428914,

"IBM Q3 Earnings AKA ""The Emperor Has No Clothes""","Original Post: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBM/comments/1fqt826/why_are_any_of_us_still_here_ibm_is_dying_and_we/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Viral Tweet: [Here](https://x.com/GayBearRes/status/1839754581728735330)

About a month ago, I shared a post that raised the question of why any of us remain with this company. Since then, it has gained significant attention on X and has become the most engaged post on this subreddit.

Today, with the release of the Q3 earnings report, I want to clarify our current situation using specific figures:

* Revenue has increased by 1% year-over-year
* Software revenue has seen a 10% rise, bolstered by a 14% increase from Red Hat and a 13% boost in automation
* Infrastructure revenue has declined by 7%, with IBM Z experiencing a significant drop of 19%
* Consulting revenue is slightly down by 0.5%
* The company claims a $3 billion generative AI segment. Gross profit margin has improved to 57.5%, largely due to cost-cutting measures rather than true revenue growth
* Free cash flow stands at $6.6 billion, but we are carrying a hefty debt of $56.6 billion
* R&D spending has decreased by 11%
* Europe and the Middle East/Africa saw a 7% revenue increase, while the Americas experienced a 2% decline

In a sector where tech firms often achieve double-digit growth, we are merely keeping our heads above water. The only noteworthy development is the 10% increase in software revenue, primarily driven by Red Hat?檚 14% growth and a 13% uptick in automation. However, even with software accounting for nearly 45% of our overall revenue, it doesn't compensate for the broader issues we face.

Our foundational business is shrinking, as evidenced by a 7% decline in infrastructure revenue and a concerning 19% drop in IBM Z. This trend raises alarms about our ability to grow or even maintain this segment.

Consulting revenue remains stagnant, with a minimal drop of 0.5%. This was supposed to be our future?攍everaging AI and cloud services to transform client operations?攂ut the lack of substantial, profitable outcomes from these investments indicates a missed opportunity for meaningful growth.

IBM continues to promote our $3 billion generative AI business as a means to capitalize on current tech trends. However, this figure represents cumulative revenue, not quarterly earnings. AI still constitutes only a small portion of our total revenue, which is around 6.6% of the overall $15 billion. It?檚 clear that AI isn't a driver of substantial growth, particularly given this quarter's modest 1% revenue increase. If AI were genuinely transformative, we would expect to see its impact on consulting or software growth. Unfortunately, we find ourselves lagging in the AI race, much like we did with cloud technology.

While our gross profit margin has improved to 58.5%, it is evident that this increase stems largely from cost reductions, following significant staff layoffs over the past quarter. This approach is not sustainable and reflects a hollow form of growth where revenues stagnate while margins rise. Although this boosts short-term profitability, it lacks a genuine strategy for long-term revenue growth.

Our free cash flow of $6.6 billion is certainly positive, but it is overshadowed by a staggering debt of $56.6 billion. While this cash flow is essential for covering dividends and debt obligations, we urgently need to see revenue growth in the near future.

We've cut R&D spending by 11%, signaling a retreat from innovation. Let?檚 not be fooled into thinking we're an innovative tech leader.

Lastly, the U.S. has traditionally been our strongest market, housing many of our largest clients. The decline in revenue within our home market is concerning, indicating that our key clients may not be renewing contracts or are reducing their business with us. Our competitors are effectively capturing our primary clients.

It?檚 essential to note that none of this information is new; these trends have been evident in previous earnings reports and can be easily verified. It?檚 time to acknowledge the reality of our situation. We?檙e not merely facing challenges; we?檙e in a critical position. Our core business is struggling, AI is a mere distraction, and cost-cutting measures can only go so far. The signs are clear, and they do not bode well for our future.

I also want to clarify that my primary aim is to shed light on the reality of working at IBM for new and potential hires, who may be misled by the company's fa莽ade of stability and innovation. Many employees feel trapped due to job security and want to leave. The systemic problems, such as outsourcing and a lack of investment in innovation, ultimately harm our collective future. It?檚 crucial for those considering a career at IBM to understand that staying here may affects their professional growth. Highlighting these issues isn?檛 just complaining; it?檚 about fostering awareness and encouraging potential hires to make informed decisions about their careers.",171,84,1729725019,
CMV: AI is a bigger problem than 99% of people think it is,"This turned into a very lengthy post, and people these days don't tend to read that much, so, taking advantage that it is about AI, [here's this text updated to modern audiences with an AI voice](https://youtu.be/_FfyiZEWvjQ). You can also just listen to it as a podcast. ^(ADM, please don't delete this post just because i put a non-listed Youtube joke video on it.)

But If you plan to read, I tried to make the text more readable by using a lot of paragraphs and bold words.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Every. single. time. that someone talk something realistic about the future of AI on society they get downvoted or downplayed. Generic phrases like **""That's not gonna happen in my lifetime""** or **""This will only create more jobs""**. Most of them do not even see the entire post, they just see ""AI"" and immediately thinks they need to talk bad about it.

I'm tired of coping. We're fucking **doomed** and almost nobody seems to be aware about it. We starting to see a coming immense wave of people being depressive because of fear of not being **useful** anymore on the job market. Nobody is doing nothing, and the governments are made of 60+ year old people that still don't know exactly what a ""Internet"" is.

The medium lifetime of a human being is 70 years, so two decades is not that much. With that in mind, tell me, what **non-manual** jobs will still be available in the next two decades. Did you fucking saw [Sora?](https://openai.com/sora) and do you remember about AI video generation [being a shit just 1 year ago](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/will_smith_eating_spaghetti.mp4?_=1)?

Let's get a bit less futuristic. Imagine a 14-year-old teenager who is considering pursuing a certain profession. Considering that this person will follow the traditional path of finishing high school, attending college, and only getting a job after graduation, he/she will only enter the job market in about **8 years**, almost a **decade**. With generative AI's advancing exponentially, and considering that the first AGI may emerge in the next decade, which job will actually survive all that time without it's market becoming **saturated, precarious, or even extinct** due to competition with AI? And how will these people continue to study and live normally knowing that the future is so uncertain?

&#x200B;

***""But this has already happened before in the industrial revolutions, and in the end, everything turned out fine!""***

&#x200B;

All past industrial revolutions were about machines replacing humans in **manual labor jobs**. Now it's different, Generative Artificial Intelligences can replace humans even in **creative, intellectual, and complex areas**, replacing people who have studied for years and years in industries we never imagined that could have robots performing it, demolishing the concept of **""stable jobs""**. The potential for damage is much greater because humanity has never experienced this level of **mass automation of specialized jobs** before.

&#x200B;

***""It will only replace you if you are lazy and don't adapt to it!***

&#x200B;

Generative AI will not **(yet)** directly replace you, they will **multiply** your **productivity** and make your job easier to the point where the job of 10 people can now be done by only 1 person, allowing companies to lay off several people to **cut costs and increase profits.**

In the end, specialized individuals (even if they have ""adapted"" to AI tools) will be replaced by a **single person** with basic (but enough) knowledge of the field who **charges much less** to deliver the same result. When people say ""AI will create more jobs"" they're actually referring to this without knowing.

Except for the highly specific and technical jobs that envolves the programming itself of these technologies, the mass of these ""new jobs"" are all about **replacing people with less people,** and those who remain will **produce more** for the **same salary.**

This will lead to a social situation where it will be practically **impossible** to get into any job if you have never worked in that area before or already has any professional contact with someone (like parents), as the demand for workers is expected to be laughably low due to the **high productivity** that these new technology advancements provides, and there will exist a large number of individuals who are no longer useful in almost any area available, but still need a job to live.

Summing it up, you **will** be replaced, but with extra steps.

&#x200B;

***""AI doesn't have the ""human factor.""***

&#x200B;

In our system, **convenience** and **profit** outweighs quality.

Imagine the following situation: a company needs a artwork for a banner. They can pay the **full price** to hire a **specialized human artist** or literally pay **nothing** to have a slightly inferior result produced by Stable Diffusion open source AI. Which option do you think they will choose? ^((This situation ignores the fact that AI's can create thousands of different artworks in minutes for the best one to be chosen or modified).)

If AI competition made you charge 90% less to work the same hours, your job is already **dead**. It doesn't need to literally vanish, **and that's the point.**

Videos generated by AI were laughably bad, right? **Look at them now**. This is what also happened to photorealistic AI images, and can you really tell me that's not going to happen to... **literally any other profession?**... Realistic, depending on how far into the future you're willing to think, every job is endangered, some just need a few more decades. I'm only talking about the next two.

Basically, AI doesn't have to embody the perfection of a human to **fuck up an entire market area**, it simply needs to make everything **easier** and more **accessible**, to the point where people **no longer feel the need to hire a human to do it**. So, there is no such thing as the ""human factor"" as long as the AI does what needs to be done.

Random vent about some programmers views about this topic, skip it if you want:

>!And talking specifically about you, pretentious programmer (not all of them, calm down) that will tell me that I'm overreacting because ""You work in the field and know how this technology works"". People are already getting prejudicated by these exponential sudden evolutions, so why did you not warned them? Because you also didn't know, and you'll still don't know. Even the creators of these technologies themselves do not know exactly what's coming in the next centuries. !<

>!Sora was being made silently and was only exposed to the public to overshadow Google's Gemini AI, you obviously didn't know that, and you'll also don't know how Sora 2.0 will be. so don't act like you know everything because you supposedly know ""how it works"". !<

>!Programming AI's are already being used to streamline processes, like autopilot, but you have to be very optimistic and naive not to realize that junior programmers are already being laid off or rejected because of this; Also, those programmers who remain don't get a salary increase, they just work more for the same money. As i said, AI's don't literally ""replace"" humans, an that applies to programming. Experienced programmers are gonna get fucked up too.!<

>!Ohh nothing's gonna happen because you know AI is not gonna get that much smarter, right? !<

>!Did the ""experienced"" programmers foresee that the junior programmers would be replaced? No? So why should i believe you when you tell me that you will not be affected by the layoffs and the ""Produce 90% more to gain the same money"" logic?!<

>!Basically, don't listen to pretentious programmers that think they ""know"" the future, they're ""false negatives"". I just added this part in the text because i know they always appear, and they're actually taken seriously by most people. Don't think i hate programmers, i'm currently studying c++ right now.!<

***""This automation will only affect jobs exclusively done in computers.""***

&#x200B;

**GPT-4** can already understand **audio, images, and text** in an almost human-like manner. It's impossible not to see the enormous potential this has to affect various areas beyond the typical ""office work."" But even if we assume that only computer-based jobs are affected, that would already be enough to cause a **mass migration** of workers to **other areas**, which would heavily impact those areas since there wouldn't be enough jobs for everyone. Even medicine could be one of them, as it is a field that will not be negatively affected by AI for now. Or government jobs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yes, I am obviously quite pessimistic about the future. Automation would theoretically be exclusively positive **(especially in a system not driven by profit)**, and I think it will eventually be someday, but the problem lies in the **transition** to that. In the next **two decades**, many people will totally lose their value in the job market, and the government has no **plan** to **contain** this or provide any social **security** for the population that will become **unemployed**.

Currently, I'm trying to learn Unreal Engine so that I can engage in something valuable to earn some money while also getting benefited by the AI automations. However, this constant mental struggle and uncertainty about the future prevent me from maintaining consistency in my efforts. I'm extremely depressive but I'm making an effort to actually stay alive socially and professionally.

I hope to become a little more optimistic and overcome this lack of perspective i have so that I can accomplish tasks. However, the future seems doomed and artificial, and I'm not sure if i wanna live in it.

Thanks if you read it till the end. Have a nice day.",140,195,1708471592,
Is anyone else scared that AI will replace their business? ,"Obviously, everyone has seen the clickbait titles about how AI will replace jobs, put businesses out of work, and all that doom-and-gloom stuff. But lately, it has been feeling a bit more realistic (at least, eventually). I just did a quick Google search for ""how many businesses will AI replace,"" and I came across a study by McKinsey & Company claiming *""that by 2030, up to 800 million jobs could be displaced by automation and AI globally"".* That's only 5 years away.

The real world moves slower than you think: a case for ChatGPT skepticism,"*Obligatory disclaimer that this is good-faith fodder for discussion, not trolling. Just trying to introduce a bit of nuance to this sub.*

**tl;dr:** LLMs will change the world, but the real world takes a long time to change.

ChatGPT (and LLMs in general) are transformative technologies. No getting around it and I'm not arguing otherwise. But too often on this sub I see claims like ""x industry will be dead by 2024"" or ""just wait 6 months and all the limits will be overcome"" treated as fact when they are fundamentally speculative.

So with the acknowledgment that LLMs may eventually be as disruptive as people are claiming (I think they will be, in time!), here are some reasons why it?檚 not going to happen as fast as people think. I?檓 starting with the technological limits, which are probably the easiest to critique, before moving into the real sticking points.

To reiterate! None of these limitations are impossible or even unlikely to be overcome. I?檓 just talking about the pace of change. These are some of the factors that will slow things down.

**Technological limitations**

* Fundamentally, generative AIs are??generative. They make content. But the value add of most jobs is not the content itself; it?檚 the judgment. It?檚 knowing the right questions to ask, the right people to talk to, the right sources to trust, etc. Until an AI can take meaningful initiative, it will be at most a tool in the hands of a more competent human worker.
* Even when it comes to content generation, while ChatGPT is better than most people at most tasks, it?檚 not better than an expert in their area of expertise. The tech may be 80% of the way there, but the last 20% will be much more difficult to pull off (even with the assumed exponential improvements in the models). That?檚 especially the case in fields where accuracy is extremely important, such as law and medicine.
* A lot of the immediate applications of ChatGPT are in the tech sector and other ?渉ard??fields, and based on the kinds of posts here it seems like developers are among the most enthusiastic early adopters. But most of the economy is not in STEM. A huge share of the economy is in sectors like the trades and the care economy where output cannot be replaced by an LLM. Even in fields that, on paper, could be disrupted, it?檚 not always so simple. In my own sector, public policy, ChatGPT is simply not capable enough to displace most of the actual work, in large part because policy work relies on fuzzy variables like political relationships, social impacts and public opinion.

**Economic limitations**

* Even where ChatGPT can technically replace workers now, it is often too costly or complicated to do so. Many firms lack the necessary expertise and are unlikely to acquire it any time soon (hell, lots of small businesses are barely using the internet). It?檚 one thing for ChatGPT to answer customer queries, it?檚 another thing entirely to build the infrastructure necessary for that to be a cost-saving investment for your business.
* As a bit of an aside, autonomous robotics, in particular, is still not economical for most real-world applications. The capital investment alone means adoption will be slow, not to mention logistical bottlenecks around manufacturing and distribution. Most low-wage service workers are not going anywhere soon.
* To build on both those points, technological adoption at a large scale is exceedingly costly in both capital and human terms. It took 20 years for some of the largest firms and governments to fully integrate the internet into their operations (never mind personal computers). Even if a CEO is fully on board with using LLMs for their accounting or HR or marketing or whatever, it takes a lot of time to build functional systems on the ground, especially when the tech is new and there aren?檛 best practices to follow.

**Socio-cultural limitations**

* Legal liability is a huge issue for firms and governments. No matter how good the tech gets, as long as there are outstanding questions about reliability and legitimacy, LLMs will never be entrusted with tasks that could legally expose these organizations.
* On a related note, privacy is a big issue and not just for the obvious candidates like banks who need to protect personal information. In places like the EU, which have stringent rules around data privacy, LLMs are unlikely to be permissible for many applications, especially if requests are being processed through U.S. servers.
* Cultural resistance, and I don?檛 just mean neo-Luddite impulses like we?檙e seeing from some governments. By and large, the managers who make decisions about staffing are older and less trusting of new tech. It?檚 going to take a long time for many managers to be comfortable downsizing their human staff for an unproven tech alternative. Worth noting that many parts of the world are not nearly as cutthroat as the U.S. tech sector. In these places, employers and governments will step in to protect their workers.
* I?檝e already mentioned privacy regulations, but labour laws and other regulations are relevant, too. Unionized workplaces won?檛 roll over. And we will undoubtedly see new regulations passed that attempt to place limits on how AI can be used.
* And perhaps most important of all: people like people. Especially when it comes to subjective fields like art and commentary, many or most humans will continue to prefer the work of other humans even where an AI can produce content that is technically indistinguishable. Stephen King is still going to sell more books than an AI Mark Twain, for example. But even at the micro level, people will keep tuning into local radio personalities and attending local colleges and hiring local marketing companies because of that human connection. Cultural acceptance of AI content will be a drawn-out fight.

To reiterate, I am not saying that LLMs like ChatGPT won?檛 have profound consequences or that these limitations won?檛 be overcome! All I?檓 saying is that sticking points like these mean it?檚 not going to happen as quickly as many hope/fear.

A good example to summarize all these points: librarians. That profession was supposed to die with the search engine, since on paper the computer could do their core job function better than a human. Yet there are [still about as many librarians today](https://www.dpeaflcio.org/factsheets/library-professionals-facts-and-figures) as ever before. Why? In short, (1) librarians do a lot more than just find/catalog sources, they also make judgments about what information is important, (2) hiring a librarian is still more economical than building out the infrastructure for automated book-shelving robots, and (3) librarians are nice?攁nd people like that.",309,206,1680714494,
Theory for a Mega Bull Case (long term),"D.O.G.E. + PLTR = PLTR could become the official OS of the entire United States Government.  

If Musk & Ramaswamy are really serious about this (and they aren't stonewalled), given the strong relationships to Thiel it isn't such an unrealistic theory: Vance ran a VC that Thiel funded, Musk from their days at PayPal, David Sacks (AI & Crypto Czar) worked with Thiel at PayPal, Jim O'Neill (deputy sec of DHS) was the CEO of Thiel's personal foundation, and others.

Many government offices are already using Palantir (DoD, FBI, Army, Space Force, etc.) not to mention local law enforcement as well (Gotham).  Then consider there is already a massive project (Maven) underway to integrate different departments from satellites, social media, air force, navy, etc. Which is part of an EVEN BIGGER project (JADC2) aiming to create an ""all-service"" battle command network.  meaning all military wings/sources would be integrated giving the ability to share and compile data from all available resources.

Now, imagine all other governmental organizations also started using PLTR and were also integrated to the same central ""model"".  Now you'd have data aggregated from treasury, FED, SEC, FBI, CIA, NSA, IRS, ATF, etc. all available and able to search each others data and look for patterns/discrepancies.  You'd be able to easily find tax evasion, money laundering, criminal behavior, governmental waste, etc.

Add in the advances in quantum computing, advances to the LLMs nearing AGI and the 5-10 year potential is frightening.  The US government (if it adopted Palantir across the board) could very likely automate almost all of the work done by human employees.  the use cases are endless:

\* Hey Palantir, I want to simplify our tax code.  Please identify every redundant line of tax code.  Next, review all of the tax codes and show their effectiveness (how many people they impact, statistics about the impacts, etc.)  Next run some financial simulations based on the following 'what if' parameters: A, B, C  


\* Hey Palantir, This is the IRS, please show me all the assets owned by tax evaders.  Identify the top 50 worst offenders.  Use the all available databases to locate them and build a complete dossier for each of them.  Rank the final list by the estimated value defined as total amount owed \* % chance of positive ID & location.  

\* Hey Palantir, show me all the anomalous trade patterns in the past 3 months.  Look specifically for trades that are likely to have resulted from insider trading.  Create a document for each clearly outlining your case and logic for having identified them as such and give a confidence rating for each.

\* Hey Palantir, analyze all trades made in the past 10 years by US politicians.  Compare their returns with that of the average market.  Also compare against the top performing hedge funds each year.  Make sure to consider what each politician's job was, which committees they were on, the topics they had inside information on, etc.  Use that to cross reference their trades and identify trades that were likely made illegally based on insider information.

I remember getting paid these nice 10 grand I started doing it full-time spent $5k of them on marketing got $30k in return, learned other exit strategies. started maximizing my assignments. made sure that the bussiness became more predictable and stable. for the folks out there trying to get their first deal or if you're having any troubles with consistency invest in your systems and yourself. all you gotta do is to believe. never had doubts it will work well for me. and here's what I implemented this year.

\-Got myself a nice CRM with call recordings and AI summary in it.  
\-Got myself the best team ever that I'm grateful for was the best decision I made when I automated the lead generation  
\-Kept learning about more exit strategies  
\-Built more connections and did a lot of JV deals as well

GET IT DONE!",39,67,1740088951,
We made a free app that automates the process of finding and applying for jobs - looking for ideas on where to get users,"With endless cycles of layoffs, 5.9 million people currently unemployed, and hundreds of thousands of college grads looking for new ways to break into the workforce - a friend and I decided to try and use our experience to attempt to create a better experience for job hunting.

**Our Product**

We've been working on building a free fully-automated end-to-end solution for managing the worst part of the job search - finding and applying to jobs.

Our system scans millions of jobs posted online across corporate career pages, generalist and specialist job boards, and job listing aggregators to curate matches for users. Every day, we automatically search and apply for a user?檚 top five matches - kind of like a dating app for jobs.

**Next Steps**

After launching our website and beta we'd love to get feedback on our product and ideas on where we should be marketing to try and get some early users. We've currently got about 20 people testing it out.

We?檇 really appreciate any feedback on the product or how to grow it, and I?檓 happy to answer any questions as well!

&#x200B;

**Edit**: Wow!! We feel so fortunate and grateful to have gotten so much feedback and testers! One big thing we wanted to call out is that we're currently only US-focused. Once we have some more testing done, and more time to expand - we'll quickly open this up for global use. But until then we're just available for US-based job seekers. Sorry for any inconvenience this caused those who tried to sign up internationally. As a startup we've got limited time and money, so we're trying to be super focused on where we target first.  


**Second Edit:** We also have gotten a million requests for a remote job option (*obviously needed)*. We've got a bug in our system that is preventing us from launching the feature - but we'll be adding it in the next few weeks! We'll reach back out to all those who requested once we add the functionality. Thanks for the feedback!",391,259,1654214665,
Hiring Market Seems Crazy,"Or maybe I'm just doing something wrong. I just finished an MS in stats at a top 3 stats department, did my MS thesis research on self attention in transformers, undergrad double major in math and econ with CS minor, and I spent 1.5 years as a data science intern at a small but established sports analytics company during my masters program. Applying to upwards of 100 DS and machine learning roles online has landed me a total of zero (0) interviews. Every job posting has like 400+ applicants (as discussed in this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15p8n46/is\_data\_sciencedata\_engineering\_over\_saturated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/15p8n46/is_data_sciencedata_engineering_over_saturated/)).  Meanwhile there is more hype and investment than ever in ""ai"" and machine learning. Is this similar to other people's experiences? It's possible my resume just has some glaring issue I haven't discovered, but I'm starting to wonder how realistic starting a career in this field really is.

Edit:

First of all thanks to everyone offering their advice and perspective on my situation, and the job market at large. My goal here is to get a sense of whether or not there's a mismatch between my job hopes/expectations and my abilities, or if I'm just going about the job search incorrectly.

For those who asked for more details about my profile, I'll try to add some color here. I don't want to turn this into me listing my resume but maybe it will help me or others understand.

Some Relevant Skills:

Been programming in python for 6 years (web-scraping, pands, numpy, sklearn, pytorch, etc), practice leetcode pretty regularly. Have used for R for 3 years, but haven't touched it in about six months so a bit rusty. Lots of experience training and engineering neural nets in pytorch, this is my strongest skill imo. Have a few research projects using pytorch I did during my masters. Also obviously proficient with mathematical statistics and probability, the stuff you get from a stats ms.

??
Internship stuff:

Lots of people asked or brought up my internship, so I'll ad more about it. The company manages a large databse of college athletes and recruits and sells access and analysis to athletic programs. I joined as an intern winter of 2022, working part time during my masters. It's a small company with 10 full time employees, completely remote. There is one other programmer/tech guy but he mostly does does pandas/web-scraping/social media automation stuff, no stats/ml. There aren't any other data science/machine learning/stats people at the company, the owner/ceo has some experience and recently worked on a data sciency project but I think he spends most of his time managing the business. For the first 8 months I was essentially a software engineer/data engineer, writing python code to scrape and clean and move datasets. Last fall I started building a system that uses an llm to automate a monthly data entry project. This project was recurring every month, and usually took a group of 6 interns and 3 full time employees about a week to finish. My system now automates between 60% and 80% of it each month, most months its closer to 80%. The project is now typically done by two full time employees and maybe 1 intern. I'm now working on a project using boosted trees to find under/over recruited athletes. The owner/ceo of the company said I can add whatever title for my internship to my resume, since its a small company there aren't officially designated tracks or titles. I'm currently using ""Data Science Intern - Machine Learning"", but can change this to anything as long as it still accurately reflects what I've been doing.

??
Academic Stuff:

Thesis focused on self-attention in NMT and image classification, essentially showed that the common interpretation of self-attention working by ""comparing words in the input"" is wrong. Currently my advisor and I are working on extending the research, he wants to try to publish and so do I. 3.5 gpa in masters program (I know this isn't great but the school has a reputation for being hard/rigorous with no grade inflation, so maybe I'll be ok?). Undergrad GPA was 3.9, 4.0 if we only look at my major (few A- grades in humanities requirements). Was in honors program, wrote an honors thesis in math (algebraic geometry), got the ""best math student"" awards from my math department junior and senior year. I know since I have a master's the undergrad stuff is less important, but maybe that will help because it was a large non-elite university, mostly known for sports.",260,187,1691935139,
"ULPT: Stuck in the ""No Experience, No Job"" Loop? Lie on Your Resume","Fake it till you make it. Embellish your resume. Add extra time to past jobs, list skills you're somewhat familiar with as if you're an expert. The goal is to get past the automated screening and into the interview room. Once you're there, your personality and enthusiasm can take over.

But what if you get grilled on those fabricated experiences? Use an AI-powered interview tool. for example [this one](https://interviewhammer.com/). This tool listens in and feeds you polished answers, making you sound confident even if you're not.

the job market isn't always fair either, so you have to make it fair for yourself.

The threat of AI and automation on our jobs is completely overblown,"It seems a lot of people are just assuming that AI is going to make everyones jobs useless and were all going to be unemployed in the next 10 years, but theres almost no evidence for any of that. The only thing that has substantial posibility of taking a lot of jobs is self driving cars. Thats it. Even elon musk admitted that he fucked up by trying to implement to much automation in his factory and that ""Humans are just better at some things"". And thats for Factory work. 

Theres no evidence that software engineers, sales people, marketing people, construction workers, shop owners ect. are going to be replaced by robots.

## Upto (Nov)

## Discord Statuses + Your Location + Facebook Poke

https://preview.redd.it/4nqt7tp2tf5c1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0223484bc54b45b5c65e0b1afd0dc52f9c02ad1

This was the end of uni, I often messaged (and got messaged) requests of status and location to (and from my) friends. I thought, what if we make a social app that?檚 super basic and all it does is show you where your friends are? To differentiate from snap maps and others we wanted something with more privacy where you select the location. However, never finished the codebase or launched it. This is because I slowly started to realize that B2C (especially social networks) are way too hard to make into an actual business and the story with Fistbump would repeat itself. However, this decision not to launch it almost launched a curse on our team. From that point, we permitted ourselves to abandon projects even before launching.

## Lessons:

* Don?檛 do social networks if your goal is 10k MRR ASAP.
* If you build something to 90% competition ship it or you will think it?檚 okay to abandon projects

## Insight Bites (Nov)

## Youtube Summarizer Extension

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h6drqej4tf5c1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f211456c390ac06f4fcb54aa51f9d50b0826658

Right after Upto, we started ideating and conveniently the biggest revolution in the recent history of tech was released ??GPT. We instantly began ideating. The first problem we chose to use AI for is to summarize YouTube videos. Comical. Nevertheless, I am convinced we have had the best UX because you could right-click on a video to get a slideshow of insights instead of how everyone else did it. We dropped it because there was too much competition and unit economics didn?檛 work out (and it was a B2C).

## PodPigeon (Dec)

## Podcast ??Tweet Threads

https://preview.redd.it/0ukge245tf5c1.png?width=2498&format=png&auto=webp&s=23303e1cab330578a3d25cd688fa67aa3b97fb60

Then we thought, to make unit economics work we need to make this worthwhile for podcasters. This is when I got into Twitter and started seeing people summarize podcasts. Then I thought, what if we make something that converts a podcast into tweets? This was probably one of the most important projects because it connected me with Jason and Jonaed, both of whom I regularly stay in contact with and are my go-to experts on ideas related to content creation. Jonaed was even willing to buy Podpigeon and was using it on his own time. However, the unit economics still didn?檛 work out (and we got excited about other things).

Furthermore, we got scared of the competition because I found 1 - 2 other people who did similar things poorly. This was probably the biggest mistake we?檝e made. Very similar projects made 10k MRR and more, launching later than we did. We didn?檛 have a coherent product vision, we didn?檛 understand the customer well enough, and we had a bad outlook on competition and a myriad of other things.

## Lessons:

* I already made another post about the importance of outlook on competition. Do not quit just because there are competitors or just because you can?檛 be 10x better. Indiehackers and Bootstrappers (or even startups) need to differentiate in the market, which can be via product (UX/UI), distribution, or both.

## Asking Ace

## Intro.co + Crowdsharing

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0hu2tt16tf5c1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d397568ef2331e78198d64fafc1a701a3e75999

As I got into Twitter, I wanted to chat with some people I saw there. However, they were really expensive. I thought, what if we made some kind of crowdfunding service for other entrepreneurs to get a private lecture from their idols? It seemed to make a lot of sense on paper. It was solving a problem (validated via the fact that Intro.co is a thing and making things cheaper and accessible is a solid ground to stand on), we understood the market (or so we thought), and it could monetize relatively quickly. However, after 1-2 posts on Reddit and Indiehackers, we quickly learned three things. Firstly, no one cares. Secondly, even if they do, they think they can get the same information for free online. Thirdly, the reasons before are bad because for the first point ??we barely talked to people, and for the second people ??we barely talked to the **wrong people**. However, at least we didn?檛 code anything this time and tried to validate via a landing page.

## Lessons

* Don?檛 give up after 1 Redditor says ?淚 don?檛 need this??* Don?檛 be scared to choose successful people as your audience.

## Clarito

## Journaling with AI analyzer

https://preview.redd.it/8ria2wq6tf5c1.jpg?width=1108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=586ec28ae75003d9f71b4af2520b748d53dd2854

Clarito is a classic problem all amateur entrepreneurs have. It?檚 where you lie to yourself that you have a real problem and therefore is validated but when your team asks you how much you would pay you say

I guess you will pay, maybe, like 5 bucks a month??

Turns out, you?檇 have to pay me to use our own product lol.

We sent it off to a few friends and posted on some forums, but never really got anything tangible and decided to move away.

Honestly, a lot of it is us in our own heads. We say the market is too saturated, it?檒l be hard to monetize, it?檚 B2C, etc.

## Lessons:

* You use the Mom Test on other people. You have to do it yourself as well. However, recognizing that the Mom Test requires a lot of creativity in its investigation because knowing what questions to ask can determine the outcome of the validation. I asked myself ?淒o I journal??but I didn?檛 ask myself ?淗ow often do I want GPT to chyme in on my reflections?? Which was practically never.
* That being said I think with the right audience and distribution, this product can work. I just don?檛 know (let alone care) about the audience that much (and I thought I was one of them)/

## Horns & Claw

## Scrapes financial news texts you whether you should buy/sell the stock (news sentiment analysis)

This one we didn?檛 even bother launching. Probably something internal in the team and also seemed too good to be true (because if this works, doesn?檛 that just make us ultra-rich fast?). I saw a similar tool making 10k MRR so I guess I was wrong.

## Lessons:

* This one was pretty much just us getting into our heads. I declared that without an audience it would be impossible to ship this product and we needed to start a YouTube channel. Lol, and we did. And we couldn?檛 even film for 1 minute. I made bold statements like ?淲e will commit to this for at least 1 year no matter what??

## Learnery

## Make courses about any subject

https://preview.redd.it/1nw6z448tf5c1.jpg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2c73e8af23b0a6c3747a81e785960d4004feb48

This is probably the most ?渟uccessful??project we?檝e made. It grew from a couple of dozen to a couple of hundred users. It has 11 buy events for $9.99 LTD (we couldn?檛 be bothered connecting Stripe because we thought no one would buy it anyway).

However what got us discouraged from seriously pursuing it more is, that this has very low defensibility, ?淲hy wouldn?檛 someone just use chatGPT???and it?檚 B2C so it?檚 hard to monetize.

I used it myself for a month or so but then stopped. I don?檛 think it?檚 the app, I think the act of learning a concept from scratch isn?檛 something you do constantly in the way Learnery delivers it (ie course). I saw a bunch of similar apps that look like Ass make like 10k MRR.

## Lessons:

* Don?檛 do B2C, or if you do, do it properly
* Don?檛 just Mixpanel the buy button, connect your Stripe otherwise, it doesn?檛 feel real and you won?檛 get momentum. I doubt anyone (even me) will make this mistake again.
* I live in my GPT bubble where I make assumptions that everyone uses GPT the same way and as much as I do. In reality, the argument that this has low defensibility against GPT is invalid. Platforms that deliver a differentiated UX from ChatGPT to audiences who are not tightly integrated into the habit of using ChatGPT (which is like - everyone except for SOME tech evangelists).

## CuriosityFM

## Make podcasts about any subject

https://preview.redd.it/zmosrcp8tf5c1.jpg?width=638&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d04ddffabef9050050b0d87939273cc96a8637dc

This was our attempt at making Learnery more unique and more differentiated from chatGPT. We never really launched it. The unit economics didn?檛 work out and it was actually pretty boring to listen to, I don?檛 think I even fully listened to one 15-minute episode.

I think this wasn?檛 that bad, it taught us more about ElevenLabs and voice AI. It took us maybe only 2-3 days to build so I think building to learn a new groundbreaking technology is fine.

## SleepyTale

## Make children?檚 bedtime stories

https://preview.redd.it/14ue9nm9tf5c1.jpg?width=807&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=267e18ec6f9270e6d1d11564b38136fa524966a1

My 8-year-old sister gave me that idea. She was too scared of making tea and I was curious about how she?檇 react if she heard a bedtime story about that exact scenario with the moral that I wanted her to absorb (which is that you shouldn?檛 be scared to try new things ie stop asking me to make your tea and do it yourself, it?檚 not that hard. You could say I went full Goebbels on her).

Zane messaged a bunch of parents on Facebook but no one really cared. We showed this to one Lady at the place we worked from at Uni and she was impressed and wanted to show it to her kids but we already turned off our ElevenLabs subscription.

## Lessons:

* However, the truth behind this is beyond just ?測ou need to be able to distribute?? It?檚 that you have to care about the audience. I don?檛 particularly want to build products for kids and parents. I am far away from that audience because I am neither a kid anymore nor going to be a parent anytime soon, and my sister still asked me to make her tea so the story didn?檛 work. I think it?檚 important to ask yourself whether you care about the audience. The way you answer that even when you are in full bias mode is, do you engage with them? Are you interested in what?檚 happening in their communities? Are you friends with them? Etc.

## User Survey Analyzer

## Big User Survey ??GPT ??Insights Report

Me and my coworker were chatting about AI when he asked me to help him analyze a massive survey for him. I thought that was some pretty decent validation. Someone in an actual company asking for help.

## Lessons

* Market research is important but moving fast is also important. Ie building momentum.
* Also don?檛 revolve around 1 user. This has been a problem in multiple projects. Finding as many users as possible in the beginning to talk to is key. Otherwise, you are just waiting for 1 person to get back to you.

## AutoI18N

## Automated Internationalization of the codebase for webapps

This one I might still do. It?檚 hard to find a solid distribution strategy. However, the idea came from me having to do it at my day job. It seems a solid problem. I?檇 say it?檚 validated and has some good players already. The key will be differentiation via the simplicity of UX and distribution (which means a slightly different audience). In the backlog for now because I don?檛 care about the problem or the audience that much.

## Documate - Part 1

## Converts complex PDFs into Excel

https://preview.redd.it/8b45k9katf5c1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57324b8720eb22782e28794d2db674b073193995

My mom needed to convert a catalog of furniture into an inventory which took her 3 full days of data entry. I automated it for her and thought this could have a big impact but there was no distribution because there was no ICP. We tried to find the ideal customers by talking to a bunch of different demographics but I flew to Kazakhstan for a holiday and so this kind of fizzled out. I am not writing this blog post linearity, this is my 2nd hour and I am tired and don?檛 want to finish this later so I don?檛 even know what lessons I learned.

## Figmatic

## Marketplace of high-quality Figma mockups of real apps

https://preview.redd.it/h13yv45btf5c1.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aaa2896aeac2f22e9b7d9eed98c28bb8a2d2cdf1

This was a collab between me and my friend Alex. It was the classic Clarito where we both thought we had this problem and would pay to fix it. In reality, this is a vitamin. Neither I, nor I doubt Alex have thought of this as soon as we bought the domain. We posted it on Gumroad, sent it to a bunch of forums, and called it a day. Same issue as almost all the other ones. No distribution strategy. However, apps like Mobin show us that this concept is indeed profitable but it takes time. It needs SEO. It needs a community. None of those things, me and Alex had or was interested in. However shortly after HTML ??Figma came out and it?檚 the best plugin. Maybe that should?檝e been the idea.

## Podcast ??Course

## Turns Podcaster?檚 episodes into a course

This one I got baited by Jason :P

I described to him the idea of repurposing his content for a course. He told me this was epic and he would pay. Then after I sent him the demo, he never checked it out.

Anyhow during the development, we realized that doesn?檛 actually work because

* A podcast doesn?檛 have the correct format for the course, the most you can extract are concepts and ideas, seldom explanations.
* Most creators want video-based courses to be hosted on Kajabi or Udemy

Another lesson is that when you pitch something to a user, what you articulate is a platform or a process, they imagine an outcome. However, the end result of your platform can be a very different outcome to what they had in mind and there is even a chance that what they want is not possible. You need to understand really well what the outcome looks like before you design the process.

This is a classic problem where we thought of the solution before the problem. Yes, the problem exists. Podcasters want to make courses. However, if you really understand what they want, you can see how repurposing a podcast isn?檛 the best way to get there.

However I only really spoke to 1-2 podcasters about this so making conclusions is dangerous for this can just be another asking ace mistake with the Redditor.

## Documate Part 2

## Same concept as before but now I want to run some ads. We?檒l see what happens.

## In conclusion

https://preview.redd.it/2zrldc9dtf5c1.jpg?width=1840&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b3105073e752ad41c23f205dbd1ea046c1da7ff

* It doesn?檛 actually matter that much whether you choose to do a B2C, or a social network or focus on growing your audience. All of these can make you successful. **What?檚 important is that you choose**. If I had to summarize my 2023 in one word it?檚 indecision. Most of these projects succeeded for other people, nothing was as fundamentally wrong about them as I proclaimed. In reality that itself was an excuse. New ideas seduce, and it is a form of discipline to commit to a single project for a respectful amount of time.

https://preview.redd.it/zy9a2vzdtf5c1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=901c621227bba0feb4efdb39142f66ab2ebb86fe

* **Distribution** is not just posting on Indiehackers and Reddit. It?檚 an actual strategy and you should think of it as soon as you think of the idea, even before the Figma designs. I like how Denis Shatalin taught me. You have to build a pipeline. That means a reliable way to get leads, launch campaigns at them, close deals, learn from them, and optimize. Whenever I get an idea now I always try to ask myself ?淲here can I find 1000s leads in one day???If there is no good answer, this is not a good project to do now.

* **Talk to users before doing anything**. Jumping on designing and coding to make your idea a reality is a satisfying activity in the short term. Especially for me, I like to create for the sake of creation. However, it is so important to understand the market, understand the audience, understand the distribution. There are a lot of things to understand before coding.

https://preview.redd.it/lv8tt96ftf5c1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c8735aa6ad795f216ff9ddfa2341712e8277724

* **Get out of your own head**. The real reason we dropped so many projects is that we got into our own heads. We let the negative thoughts creep in and kill all the optimism. I am really good at coming up with excuses to start a project. However, I am equally as good at coming up with reasons to kill a project. And so you have this yin and yang of starting and stopping.
* **Building momentum and not burning out**. I can say with certainty my team ran out of juice this year. We lost momentum so many times we got burnt out towards the end. Realizing that the project itself has momentum is important. User feedback and sales bring momentum. Building also creates momentum but unless it is matched with an equal force of impact, it can stomp the project down. That is why so many of our projects died quickly after we launched. The smarter approach is to do things that have a low investment of momentum (like talking to users) but result in high impact (sales or feedback). Yes, that means the project can get invalidated which makes it more short-lived than if we built it first, but it preserves team life energy.

At the end of 2023 here is a single sentence I am making about how I think one becomes a successful indiehacker.

>One becomes a successful Indiehacker when one starts to solve pain-killer problems in the market they understand, for an audience they care about and consistently engage with for a long enough timeframe.

Therefore an unsuccessful Indiehacker in a single sentence is

>An unsuccessful Indiehacker constantly enters new markets they don?檛 understand to build solutions for people whose problems they don?檛 care about, in a timeframe that is shorter than than the time they spent thinking about distribution.

However, an important note to be made. Life is not just about indiehacking. It?檚 about learning and having fun. In the human world, the best journey isn?檛 the one that gets you the fastest to your goals but the one you enjoy the most. I enjoyed making those silly little projects and although I do not regret them, I will not repeat the same mistakes in 2024.

But while it?檚 still 2023, I have 2 more projects I want to do :)

EDIT: For Devs, frontend is always react with vite (ts) and backend is either node with express (ts) or python. For DB either Postgres or mongo (usually Prisma for ORM). For deployment all of it is on AWS (S3, EC2). In terms of libraries/APIs

How Can We Make Job Hunting in Canada Less Stressful?,"Hi everyone,

As someone who?檚 been closely following trends in the job market, I?檝e noticed how time-consuming and exhausting job hunting can be for many Canadians, especially fresh grads or those transitioning into new fields. Sending out countless applications, rewriting resumes, and tailoring cover letters for every role can feel like a full-time job itself!

I?檇 love to hear your thoughts:

* What?檚 been your biggest challenge when looking for a job in Canada?
* Do you think hiring processes could benefit from more automation, like AI matching candidates to roles based on their skills and experience?
* How do you feel about replacing traditional resumes with more skill-focused approaches?

***Disclaimer***\*: I?檓 working on a project aimed at improving the hiring process in Canada and am genuinely interested in hearing community feedback on these challenges. This isn?檛 a promotional post, I?檓 here to learn from your experiences.\*



**Update:** Thanks to everyone for the robust discussion! ",53,79,1735502096,
AI is dead,"TL;DR: AI training is leading to dumber AI, which means AI progress is far behind what idiot finance AI bros expected with their valuations. However, smart people will continue investing into AI development because the bubble supercharged understanding of AI and infrastructure for AI development


I?檓 a physician. 2 years ago, I looked at chat gpt and was pretty sure that mfer was going to take my job. This thing was outperforming everyone in conceptualizing cases and cutting through to weeds to make intricate diagnoses. 

I was obsessed with AI over the past 2 years and I used it for a whole host of uses, even going as far as starting an AI company to help doctors with AI tools. 

Outside of my direct work, I was using AI to write various publications I needed, most regularly, recommendation letters. I fed chat gpt my writing samples and tinkered with it to create highly personalized, extremely nuanced samples. At the time, I could have it write a completely made up narrative for a rec letter that tied in values brought up in a students personal statement and used coded language typical of rec letters while delivering it in my unique voice. It was incredible and it saved me so much time.

Fast forward to today. The AI tools I developed for physicians no longer work because the AI is no longer capable of thinking in subtle or nuanced ways. All the outputs are generic bullshit with no thought. The writing has gone in the same exact direction, and now I can barely use it to put together an outline for a rec letter. 

Look across the AI world and you?檒l see the problem: AI has become too generic. There?檚 a distinct writing style that it refuses to stray from. There?檚 a distinct art style that it refuses to change. 2 years ago, I could ask for an impressionist painting, and I?檇 be impressed. Now it?檚 just the same 3d render crap all over the internet. 

I?檓 not an expert in the fundamentals of AI, but from my understanding, the speed of AI training has skyrocketed and AI benchmarks are better than ever. I have no idea what that shit means, but as a formerly heavy user of AI tools, I?檓 not seeing that in the end product. What I?檓 seeing is basically schizophrenia; profound intellectual limitations brought on by an overwhelming amount of information that can?檛 be cleaned up. 

Now I?檓 not saying there aren?檛 other AI systems that are smart, but the AI boom was essentially set off by chat gpt and chat gpt wrapper companies. Many Companies not directly running on chat gpt were using insights developed by Open AI to guide their AI development. That means most AI are likely having the same issue of polluted training that?檚 getting harder and harder to clean up.  

All that being said, AI developers are in a great place. They learned a lot of great lessons and they had a chance to build out massive infrastructure and data centers. They will likely have to move several steps back in their AI development before they can move forward again, but it?檒l be far easier and faster than the first time around

Of course, Wall Street doesn?檛 give a shit about lessons learned, they care about money earned. The expectation was basically that most humans would be jobless vagrants by the end of next year, and they would be on their mega yachts earning of companies pretty much completely automated off AI. Every layoff was seen as a step towards that goal, and they could barely keep their dystopian dreams in their pants, throwing out giant green boners at every layoff announcement. 

Now AI is sputtering and companies are about to make an about face, completely destroying the narrative.

You see, the jobs reports paint an extremely clear picture for us- hiring is at a low, but firings and unemployment are steady. Basically everyone has a hiring freeze until interest rates go down and they can invest in expansions or refinance loans. This is a different story than ?渉iring are down, firings are up, all jobs to the AI??
So where does this leave us? Pretty much in a similar place to the dot com bubble. The idiots are about to think AI is a useless gimmick just like they thought the internet would be a useless gimmick when pets.com sold for a billion times more than it would ever be worth. When the bubble bursts, the smart people will continue working and the economy will be rebuilt with human/AI collaboration at the core of most workflows within a decade. 

In the mid term, All stocks will likely retreat over the next month or two, with a possible crash among AI heavy tech stocks. Once the economy is confirmed to not have crashed, the market will likely have a quick recovery into a steady bull market though the end of November into January. 

Over the following year, governmental policy will determine how well the economy expands and what sectors benefit the most. In 3-4 years, we?檒l have a rotation back into AI fields as the tech matured and gains actual, functional adoption.

That?檚 my theory at least, wtf do I know, I?檓 just a Wendy?檚 cashier ranting at some drunk regards. And yes, the fries are already in the back, ketchup too, next In line please",0,153,1725823385,
"CMV: With the rise of automation and AI, there will eventually come a time where a universal basic income is necessary.","Throughout human history, advances in technology have allowed workers to be more productive. For instance, the steel plow allowed a farmer to farm much more land and the factory allowed a chain of workers to produce much more than they ever could on their own. In relatively recent history, many of these advances have caused job loss in their fields. The combine harvester, fertilizer, and many other staples of the modern farm have made farmers less than 2% of the population in the US, down from over half a century ago. Improvements in shipping have allowed many factory jobs to be shipped overseas where labor is cheaper, while at home, domestic factory jobs that remained were replaced by robotic assembly lines that are safer and much faster than hiring actual workers. 

(Side note, I will be using the 5-sector model of the economy, described [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/sectors-of-the-economy-1435795), because it represents what jobs in the future are likely to be).

Thankfully, low-skill workers have always been able to find jobs. When the Primary sector decayed, they moved to manufacturing jobs. When the Secondary sector moved overseas, they moved to service jobs. Because of human adaptability, there have always been jobs that are easier for a low-skill human to work than a machine.

However, with the rise of information technologies, many jobs that employ millions of people will soon be at risk. [Retail clerks, for instance, are already growing obsolete.](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13842592/amazon-go-new-cashier-less-convenience-store) Many other jobs that can be handled by low-skill workers will be quick to follow. [Fast food workers](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/meet-flippy-a-burger-grilling-robot-from-miso-robotics-and-caliburger/), [construction workers](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/02/technology/3d-printed-building-mit/index.html), [taxi drivers](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14687346/uber-self-driving-car-arizona-pilot-ducey-california), and many more may soon find themselves out of work with no place to go. Most of the new and rising job markets, such as in web design, data analysis, and medicine require more than just a high school diploma. While there are still low-skill jobs that would be tough to automate, there will be a shortage of jobs that don't require a college degree.

While many of the problems I mentioned so far can be solved with more college education, it gets much worse when you throw machine learning into the mix. 

Occupations such as administrative support, accounting and other financial services, data analysis, doctors, and even middle management can be automated through machine learning algorithms already in the works. It wouldn't be too far-fetched to assume that even Quaternary sector jobs could be automated by AI. Given the rate at which AI is advancing, it's likely that artificial intelligence will replace humans in every role that it can because it's cheaper, faster, and more effective at doing the same job. 

This brings us to the universal basic income. Aside from service jobs that require human-to-human interaction, human creativity, or moral judgment and Quinary-sector jobs (I sincerely hope humans would not let AIs replace CEOs or politicians), there would be few jobs left for humans to fill. With a growing population, it's likely that there won't be enough jobs for everyone.

However, there would be way more than enough goods and services to go around. Fully automated farms and factories could get products to consumers with almost no human intervention while AIs and robots could provide people with nearly every service they could ever need. However, to pay for this abundance of services, people need money. With only a small fraction of the population in the workforce, most people would not be earning the money they'd need to pay for these services.

This doesn't make any sense. If there are more goods and services to go around than humanity could ever need, then everyone should be able to buy them. A universal basic income would be the only thing short of full communism that could make this possible. 

Unfortunately, this economic system would be almost communist in nature. Is there anything else that can be done? If so, Change My View!

(Of course, none of this would matter if a cataclysm or dystopia happens and everyone is fighting for their survival. Let's just assume we make it through the next century with the peace and prosperity we have known and we adapt to or solve Climate Change.)

EDIT: This been up for about 4 hours, and while it's been good talking to you all, it's past midnight for me. Many of you have made some good points and will probably continue to do so for several more hours, so I will respond to them once I wake up in the morning.

EDIT 2: Sorry for the inactivity, I've been at an amusement park all day and it's hard to debate on my phone. I will read through your comments and respond from 8pm-12am EDT. 

EDIT 3: After reading through the posts, I have come across a lot of good ideas. Many of you proposed alternative solutions to a UBI. There were also some plausible scenarios given where automation simply isn't worth the economic collapse, so there aren't enough poor people for a UBI to be necessary. My favorite was the idea that humans should merge themselves with computers rather than let AIs run rampant. Ironically, Elon Musk (who thinks that a UBI will be necessary) [actually has a venture devoted towards merging mind and machine.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs)

What is the future of automation in anesthesiology? Should one be worried about the job market?,"I follow a few anesthesiologists on Twitter and came across the failure of the Sedasays machine from a few years back. But with a recent article being published on the topic of automation in anesthesiology, it has got me interested and, admittedly, concerned about the future of the specialty. Being only a third-year med student, I don?檛 know what to make of any of this. From my understanding, radiology and pathology are one of the few field where automation and AI will change those professions sooner than others. Is this a legitimate concern? Or, should it only be viewed as positive in that perhaps it streamlines certain tasks for anesthesiologists?

**CRITICAL STUFF**

* Permissions Change. New [View All Fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_view_all_fields.htm&release=254&type=5) per Object allows [overriding FLS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.draes.meta/draes/draes_introduction.htm) for a Permission Set (a RN so great it's [listed twice](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_cdp_2025_spring_view_fields_perm.htm&release=254&type=5)). View all and Modify All have also [been renamed](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_rename.htm&release=254&type=5) with no functional change, because apparently [that was a priority](https://i.redd.it/97n3f6sh5sy41.png).
* Remember that ICU Locale Format change we've been warning about since [checks notes] [FIVE YEARS AGO](https://i.imgur.com/7VX5S.jpg)? [ICU LOCALE FORMAT CHANGE CAN BREAK YOUR SHIT](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_customization_globalization_enable_icu_locale_formats_release_update.htm&release=254&type=5), PLEASE TAKE TIME TO REVIEW IT. [Apex needs to be v45+, classes all need to be checked, etc](https://help.salesforce.com.mcas.ms/s/articleView?id=000380618&type=1). Yes we already told you to do this [a year ago](https://wiki.sfxd.org/books/salesforce-releases/page/spring-24-abridged). If your org handles international data and you haven't reviewed this yet, [you're gonna have a bad time](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/youre-gonna-have-a-bad-time).
* [Breaking MDAPI Change that breaks anything targeting Roles and Subordinates](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sharing_roles_update.htm&release=252&type=5) from last release is now a release update enforced in 1 release. Seeing as the target API v is 45+, it makes this [Old Version Retirement redundant to an extent](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=release-notes.rn_api_retirement_delay_254rn.htm&release=254&type=5)
* If you used a Shared Domain Certificate for the Salesforce CDN [update to single domain ASAP to avoid disruptions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_experiences_eol_shared_cert.htm&release=254&type=5)
* If you [haven't ever read a release note](https://media.tenor.com/images/9443844cf849e5252beb597426023a4e/tenor.gif), you might have missed the [Enhanced Domain Timeline](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.domain_name_enhanced_timeline.htm&type=5). If you did, know that this release is the last one where your legacy domains [work in production](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_domains_update_legacy_ru.htm&release=254&type=5), and you can [turn off these redirects manually](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_domains_legacy_disable.htm&release=254&type=5)


**GENERAL STUFF**

* Foundations (so, [literally everyone](https://imgflip.com/i/9ivjml) who activates this free option) gives you [free AI Agent allocations](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_foundations_try_out_agents.htm&release=254&type=5). Listing details in the Release Note was seemingly too hard for their marketing department so the allocations are:  1,000 Sales/Service agent conversations and 200,000 Einstein requests. It's awesome to test out usecases.
* Related Lists now allow you to [sort by multiple columns !](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_list_views_mcs_related_lists.htm&release=254&type=5) and show [API Name](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_list_views_related_list_component_configuration.htm&release=254&type=5) so you can _finally_ rename that ""Orders (Really)"" Object Name you left when you overrode standard Orders 10 years ago and never got around to fixing it
* Setup now has ~~ads~~ _suggestions_ that are based on your Clouds and user actions. That will _never_ go down a slippery slope, no sir.
* [Per-Profile Search Filters](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_search_manager_explicit_filters.htm&release=254&type=5) configurable from the Search Manager. The search team continues their quest to make [finding stuff actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEXWLbJHOaQ)
* Better Lookup Search [display and sort](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_advanced_lookup_ux_enhancements.htm&release=254&type=5)
* I don't know if I like or hate this. Activity Field limits go [up to 300](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_fields_activities_custom_fields.htm&release=254&type=5) but only if you have less than 400 million activities. Who needs that many fields ? Why are they abusing the infamous WhatId, which is probably why they have those fields ? What happens if you have 350mil records and go above 400? So many questions, that Agentforce can't answer properly [(nice hallucination btw)](https://imgur.com/a/VairQKv).
* The New Account email for Internal Users is now [a modifiable Template](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_customize_welcome_email.htm&release=254&type=5) so it can be less ugly !
* Salesforce (because of a random product, but whatever) now officially recommends setting up [bypasses for Validation Rules and APEX Triggers](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.bypass_triggers_validations.htm&type=5), like we have done [for the past 10 years :D](https://wiki.sfxd.org/books/best-practices/page/validation-rules-writing-conventions) - [Too bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOoaNE6xo4Q) you still can't pick Permissions in Flow entry criteria
* Account plans [are now elevated from a notebook to standard Reports](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_account_plans_objectives.htm&release=254&type=5), but the Multi-Task and [Object Sales Action Plan](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_action_plans.htm&release=254&type=5) it's tied to is actually [quite nice](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_feature_core_accounts_account_whitespace.htm&release=254&type=5) for Sales teams. I'm not sure why they're [multiplying apps for people to get into though](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_features_core_prospecting_center.htm&release=254&type=5)
* Forecasts get [renamed](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_forecasts_naming_unification.htm&release=254&type=5) (but not yet [reamed](https://businessnote.co.uk/drilling-vs-boring-vs-reaming-whats-the-difference/)) and get minor updates on their [judgement](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_forecasts_split_judgments.htm&release=254&type=5) module, and a BIG update regarding [consumption forecasting](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sales_consumption_forecasting.htm&release=254&type=5) which I'm guessing they're using internally to see how much they can [milk from your Data Cloud credits](https://www.merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/source-original/2021-03-03_12-19-53---31b3b37cbe2e2c66c02dd4c5dbfd2069.png)
* QoL login updates, you can now login [with your email address instead of your username](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_log_in_with_email.htm&release=254&type=5) if you go through login.salesforce.com (and your company hasn't deactivated logins from outside MyDomain) and reset your password with [MFA instead of security questions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_mfa_password_reset.htm&release=254&type=5), while the [link doesn't expire in a single click](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_password_confirmation_page.htm&release=254&type=5) (probably because SF got tired of showing [Microsoft Admins](http://pop-verse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/it-crowd-banner-620x330.jpg) how to do proper whitelisting for email link inspections)
* Messaging for In App and Web gets [Fallback Messages](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_functional_fallback.htm&release=254&type=5) if there's downtime, [Messages straight from Account/Contact/Lead Records](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_start_from_lead.htm&release=254&type=5), better [style](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_custom_window_size.htm&release=254&type=5) [management](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_custom_font.htm&release=254&type=5) and [cleanup](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_remove_components.htm&release=254&type=5)
* Being able to import [Third-Party Conversation History via API](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_messaging_ingest_bot_history.htm&release=254&type=5) allows you to handle Cases in Salesforce even if they don't have your Chat dollars.
* Voice is now [available outside of Console Navigation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_voice_standard_app.htm&release=254&type=5) and can be leveraged [even if you only use Desk Phones](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_voice_deskphone.htm&release=254&type=5)
* Reassigning Omnichannel Cases was a pain point that [now doesn't exist anymore](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_omni_reassign_work.htm&release=254&type=5) as the function is now standard.
* [Data Mask import on Sandbox Refresh](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_data_mask_run_on_refresh.htm&release=254&type=5) is nice. I mean it does require data mask, and you can do the same thing with SF CLI and [snowfakery](https://snowfakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for free, but now you can pay for convenience.
* System Overview [gets CMTD information](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_customization_general_system_overview_cmt.htm&release=254&type=5). Whether System Overview will stay updated or go the way of [Optimizer](https://issues.salesforce.com/issue/a028c00000zjGepAAE/optimizer-is-not-accessibledisabled-for-all-orgs) (RIP in pieces) is still to be determined.
* LEX Adoption Apps are [getting retired](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_lightning_adoption_apps_retirement.htm&release=254&type=5), which is logical as if you're still using Classic you probably are so knee-deep in dependencies you'll never migrate without a new org anyway.


**ANALYTICS**

* You can now set a single email address that [report notifications will come from](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_rd_org_wide_email_address_for_report_subscriptions.htm&release=254&type=5)
* Refresh a [Single widget](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_rd_refresh_individual_widgets.htm&release=254&type=5) on a  dashboard instead of the entire page and waiting [30+ seconds](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/530423258810679316.webp?size=96&animated=true) for everything to load again.
* [Report Chart order follows Sort](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_rd_sort_charts_in_reports.htm&release=254&type=5)
* Custom Report Type Lightning view is [now GA](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_rd_sort_charts_in_reports.htm&release=254&type=5), previously Beta


**ADMINISTRATION**

* Permission Summaries [allow adding and removing PermSets from a Group](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_included.htm&release=254&type=5) which is a huge timesaver. You can also [remove custom permission](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permissions_summaries_remove.htm&release=254&type=5) but not add them because... ? Public Groups [also get better Summary views for Access Control](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_manage_public_groups_access_summary.htm&release=254&type=5)
* 'Enhanced ' Permission Sets List views [means that it's not in Classic view anymore](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_permission_sets_enhanced_list_view.htm&release=254&type=5), and same for [Role](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_improved_performance_enhanced_role_list_view.htm&release=254&type=5)
* If Sharing Rules open visibility to External Users, you now get [a warning in a pop-up](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_sharing_records_external_users.htm&release=254&type=5) to ensure you didn't [involuntarily share your entire client database](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Equifax-announces-major-security-breach-affecting-143-million-customers-in-the-U-S.247290.0.html).
* Salesforce now supports [External Clients](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_eca_saml.htm&release=254&type=5) for SSO apps, SAML that is [undergoing upgrades](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_multi_config_saml.htm&release=254&type=5) [and require verification](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_verify_saml_integrations.htm&release=254&type=5)
* If you're wondering where your Edit Filters button went, it's [in the Filters icon](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_list_views_edit_list_filters.htm&release=254&type=5) for ""coHeRence""


**FLOWS**

* Screen Actions were triggerable via button, and can now also be triggered via [value changes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_automate_flow_builder_enhance_user_experience_with_automatically_triggered_screen_actions_beta.htm&release=254&type=5) on Screens.

**DEVELOPMENT**

* [SLDS V2](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_slds_themes_beta.htm&release=254&type=5) is out in Beta. Find new ways that your custom styling broke, especially with the [DOM changes in Base Components](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lc_native_shadow_dom_254.htm&release=254&type=5), and this delicious change [casually changing whitespace behavior, including hacks you might have done using empty style definitions!](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_style_class.htm&release=254&type=5) ! Also listed [twice](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_slds_slds2.htm&release=254&type=5) in the release notes for good measure !
* [Agentforce for Developers](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_tools_e4d.htm&release=254&type=5) is free in most editions and requires you to setup a [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-expanded) to use it. Let's hope it's better than their Agentforce on the help site.
* An understated release allows you to [Pause and Resume Scheduled Jobs using APEX](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_scheduledjobs.htm&release=254&type=5) allowing stuff like an emergency button to suspend background calculations on your custom order bulk job that totally isn't running with shit data just before your Sales meeting.
* @wire `config` and `prop` argument types must now [match between the type of `adapter`](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_wire_type_check.htm&release=254&type=5) for ""type checking""
* [Minor deployment limits change](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_fields_field_type_conversion.htm&release=254&type=5) for people who hugely abuse Field Type Conversions. We _assume_ that ""The limit is 85 million custom field type conversions"" means *85 mil records* and not individual fields, for logical reasons. Limits also change for [Long Running APEX requests](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_Apexlimit.htm&release=254&type=5) depending on your license count.
* [Component Import checks](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lc_access_imports.htm&release=254&type=5) is phrased like better security for developers but feels more like something to stop people using packaged components in ways the developers hadn't intended, which may break stuff. 
* In other ""[title does not match content](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/troubleshoot/entra/entra-id/app-integration/error-code-aadsts50011-reply-url-mismatch)"" releases, APEX [Reparenting Restriction Enforcement](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_reparenting.htm&release=254&type=5) is actually ""we changed the error message you'd get and when you'd get it"" instead of ""we disallowed previous behavior.""
* ZIP files, a format that totally isn't old and superseded by 7zip or rar since 1998, is now [officially supported in APEX](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_apex_compression.htm&release=254&type=5), a language that is evolving FAST.

* The OpenAPI Document Generation [gets minor updates](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_api_rest_openapi_spec_beta.htm&release=254&type=5). I'm putting it in because the day OAPI spec generation goes GA I'll put it in _Critical_ due to the amount of awesomeness.
* After [APEX Exceptions last release](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_eventlogfile_apexunexpectedexception.htm), BulkAPIV2 jobs [join the ranks of stuff you can follow via Platform Events](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_api_bulk_v2_platform_events.htm&release=254&type=5)

* Local Dev is [GA](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_local_dev.htm&language=en_US&release=254&type=5) and allows you, as before, to see locally changes you do to a LWC so you don't have to deploy every single commit.
* [New developer guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lc_lws_locker_guide_migration.htm&release=254&type=5) shows everything related to security in both Aura and LWC components, incl. LWS and Lightning Locker.

* LWC API 63.0 [provides 0 changes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_versioning.htm&release=254&type=5) which means that it's a great moment to test your versioning because [it's required now](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lwc_api_version_required.htm&release=254&type=5).
* [Defer Inactive Page Load](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_general_lex_console_tab_loading.htm&release=254&type=5) seems like Salesforce optimizing their infrastructure costs and shifting it to us. If you specifically have long-loading pages that open in the back while users do other stuff, you need to turn this off.
* Headless Login [gets security updates and PKey identification](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_experiences_identity_pointer.htm&release=254&type=5) which allows [logging in with pretty much any attribute as the identifier](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_headless_discovery.htm&release=254&type=5) - the better [error support](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_headless_registration_errors.htm&release=254&type=5) helps handling (lol) this.
* [Biometric Login for communities](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_experiences_biometric_login_button.htm&release=254&type=5)
* You get free Event Monitoring for [Blocked Redirections](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_em_blocked_redirect.htm&release=254&type=5) and [CSP Violations](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_em_csp_violation.htm&release=254&type=5), with easy access through [a PermSet](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_em_permission.htm&release=254&type=5) - which is great because [Release Updates impact those](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_other_update_csp_ru.htm&release=254&type=5). It's just too bad that we don't get [Event Logs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_em_elo.htm&release=254&type=5) for free too, because that shit looks dope AF.

What SWE folks are getting right (and wrong) about LLMs.,"Yes, LLMs can't build a full web app, or something like that, but that's not really because they aren't smart enough.

LLMs have demonstrated extremely high capabilities to reason. Just look at how it's doing on CodeForce or AIME, tasks that are arguably more difficult than most SWE tasks out there.

This is mostly due to advancements in inference time scaling, notably utilizing Chain of Thought, which has proven to have pushed LLMs from merely producing tokens to having proper, symbolic reasoning using it. Chain of thought is essentially thinking longer to solve a problem, and they are doing it 10x faster than normal humans.

The problem with SWE is that it is an extremely large scope task, most people expect AI to somehow produce results that would take a human days to do. Even if you divide that by 10 times, it would still be hours. IDK but it seems rather impossible we can beat Darwinian evolution in a matter of years (in terms of offering a more efficient model to the human brain) Chain of thought produces a lot of tokens and there lacks study and work that could allow it to maintain consistent reasoning at that quantity. So yes, in this sense, LLMs cannot automate SWE tasks.

But on the other hand, at least based on the information we have, whether that be scaling inference time or improving stability on longer chains of thought tasks, it does not appear there are immediate problems needed to be resolved (in terms of say, P vs NP). Which naturally, would extend its ability to most SWE projects. They are already smarter than most people (and likely myself), with regards to logical reasoning, but just that the ability to reason continuously hasn't been achieved.

I'm a researcher working on LLMs at a top US university, I have nothing to gain by spreading ""AGI is coming next month"" sentiments because that also means I'd be out of a job soon. But I think people need to look at this problem rationally, and not resort to fear-mongering or making ignorant statements like ""LLM is only predicting the next set of tokens"" - they aren't, much less than ""Humans are only triggering synapses between their neurons"" sort of generalization. You do need to understand that there is an academic term in the field of science called ""**emergence**"", and larger LLM models have already demonstrated various emergent capabilities, and there is no reason not to believe this exists. Emergence alone disproves this sentiment. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)

With regards to ""oh they aren't conscious"", I'm sorry but this is a problem no one is capable of answering. I've studied the philosophy of mind academically for some time in the past and none of my professors could ever dare say that definitively, which is why I tend to bypass this issue and simply focus on what we can evaluate - logical reasoning capacities. We think about AIs so much that we tend to forget how we reason - we don't even know that. It's quite ironic that we currently understand reasoning, conscious and logic processing more with regards to AIs than we do with ourselves (or any biological brains).

Either way, AI will sooner or later have a significant impact on the job market, don't underestimate it. Best advice is to climb up the ladder as much as possible so you'd be the one laying off low tier devs.",0,74,1737907886,
"Salesforce ($CRM) will lead (and profit from) the AI ""Digital Worker"" revolution","**TLDR:**  AI will start replacing jobs at a faster pace in 2025.  Salesforce has first-mover advantage in Agentic AI - a **$7t** market.  Expect the stock to shoot up as sales agreements and milestones are announced over the coming months.
________________________________

I feel like the market is sleeping on Salesforce.  All this cash being spent on GenAI/datacenters is so that these models can be utilized in a software solution that make workers more efficient.  So far it's the best way to monetize AI, and it's exactly what Salesforce is hyper-focused on.  In my mind, I don?檛 see how Salesforce doesn't end up dominating the Agentic AI space, and making a ton of money doing it.

Since a lot of people much smarter than I am are selling the stock, maybe I?檓 missing something.  I?檇 appreciate if you could take a look through my post and let me know your thoughts.

**Positions:**  ~$25k shares, ~$10k calls generally targeting $450 by Dec 2025.  Will continue to buy through to the end of the month, to total around $50k.

##Salesforce has first dibs on the new ?淒igital Worker??market

There?檚 a general anxiety that eventually, AI will take everyone?檚 job.  While it?檚 safe to say that much of the labour force has nothing to worry about in the coming decade, there are some jobs that AI would consider low-hanging fruit:  call center staff, sales/project coordinators, customer success reps...  These types of jobs could be replaced much sooner than the rest.

The market is teetering near all-time highs waiting to see whether the AI bubble will solidify, or pop.  Many have said that AI is all hype, and that until the technology makes significant advancements, the rising valuations are unwarranted.  Many others think that the AI hype will be confirmed as real in the near future.

Salesforce, in the meantime, is accepting the challenge.  In Sept ??4 they announced Agentforce, an Agentic AI platform, which they released a month later.  In December, they announced Agentforce 2.0, which includes additional features.  It seems like they?檝e got all hands on deck building and selling this new product.  Benioff (CEO) is pretty shamelessly hocking the product as well to anyone that will listen.

In my opinion, Salesforce is pivoting away from being a CRM company, to an Agentic AI company.  In the coming years, Agentforce revenue will make up a higher and higher percentage of their revenue.  As their AI advances, it stands to reason that Agentforce will even cannibalize CRM seats ??for much more revenue, of course.

[Digital labour is predicted to be a $7t market in the coming years](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent), and Salesforce appears to be the first-mover, on top of already having the advantage of being the biggest SaaS company in the world.  I don?檛 see how this plays out any other way than them taking a good chunk of the $7t market for themselves.

###Reasons I?檓 bullish
#####1. Massive existing customer base with an easy upsell
They are deeply entrenched with thousands customers (including 90% of the Fortune 500).  A lot of them already have Slack installed.  For some of the bigger accounts, they are already hosting training-relevant data in ?淒ata Cloud??  For many clients, it?檚 possible that deploying agents would require not much more than a bit of configuration.  Licensing model is ?減ay-as-you-go?? so sign-ups should be easy to get. Agentforce revenue should start hitting the books fairly soon.

#####2. New clients/segments
Salesforce can use the promise of efficient digital labour to close customers that were previously on the fence.  On top of that, they can now approach segments that had no prior interest in Salesforce at all.  (See the recently announced [Agentforce for Retail](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/01/10/agentforce-retail-cloud-pos-announcement/))

#####3.	The Benioff Factor
You don?檛 have to like the guy, but Benioff is pushing Agentforce like his life depended on it.  Given his track record with Salesforce and the sheer shamelessness in his recent behaviour on social media (which I only recently started paying attention to), I can?檛 help but see him as a positive factor as it relates to the success of the Agentforce launch and the stock in general.

Recently Benioff has ingratiated himself to Musk over social media.  [Last month, Benioff suggested that Musk?檚 DOGE could use Agentic AI to reduce costs in government.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-doge-has-a-real-shot-at-cutting-costs-and-new-technologies-could-help-131314725.html)  It's possible DOGE recommends AI agents as a govt cost-cutting measure.  Salesforce is ready for that:

> ""We already have relationships with a lot of government agencies. We're already talking to them about how to bring this technology in to create more efficient agencies. And we want to continue to have even more conversations, not just with the US government, but all the governments that we have relationships within the world, really all companies. Everybody needs to embrace this technology,"" Benioff said.

#####4. All Hands On Deck
Salesforce has practically rebranded itself as an Agentic AI company in the past few months.  It has reconfigured the organization to focus almost entirely on Agentforce.  If they were simply releasing a new AI feature, then there would be a risk of, for example, Microsoft announcing a competing product, or ServiceNow being a serious contender.  But as it stands, simply due to the fact that they are not holding anything back, there will be no catching up to Agentforce.

#####5. Agentforce used internally at Salesforce
Benioff has stated that Salesforce is using Agentforce internally and that it is already significantly reducing the workload on staff.  If true, this is extremely bullish for two reasons.  Obviously, it serves as a POC for their customers, making Agentforce not only easier to sell, but quicker to deploy.  For me though, a more interesting take on this is that Benioff now needs to demonstrate a visible reduction in Salesforce operating expenses, which should increase net profit.  This would need to be shown on the next earnings call, on both reported numbers, and FY26 forecasts.

#####6. 2025 ??the year of Agentic AI
AI will be the focus in 2025 as the market tries to justify the Mag 7?檚 furious spending on AI infrastructure.  In the past week both Jensen Huang and Satya Nadella have made statements claiming that Agentic AI is where SaaS is going.  If that is indeed the focus of 2025, and if Salesforce/Benioff continue screaming to anyone that will listen that they are 100% all in, it should create excitement around both the product, as well as the stock.  

#####7. Fundamentals

Salesforce is fairly priced at the moment, with a FP/E of 26.  Compared to other SaaS companies like ServiceNow (60) or HubSpot (77) it's an absolute bargain.  It's priced even better than Microsoft (34).  

#####8.	Future Potential (watch as I go off the deep end)
Agentforce is only the first step.  As AI develops, a more advanced version will essentially function as a fully capable employee, with access to all company data posted on Salesforce Data Cloud.  It will also have access to abstracted data across all of Salesforce, making it the most knowledgeable, experienced salesperson(?) in the world.

Is that a bit farfetched?  Maybe.  Impossible?  I don?檛 think so...  But what?檚 true, is that Salesforce is the only company with access to all that data.  I think it's likely that they will ultimately be able to pull it off.

###Bearish points + counter-arguments:

#####1.	New business model

Agentforce comes at a price tag of $2 per conversation.  I don?檛 think we know what that means yet, because this technology and the use-case is entirely new.  How many Agentforce conversations will an Enterprise customer use per month?  10,000?  500,000?  How many of the agent use-cases will actually perform well?  It?檚 going to be very hard to forecast revenue growth in the coming year, which adds uncertainty.  (Contrast this, for example, to a licensing model where users would simply have to upgrade to a license that cost an additional 30%.)

**Counter:**  While it?檚 hard to predict the expected revenue growth in the coming months, the positive angle is that this pricing model shows Salesforce?檚 extreme confidence in the product.  (Microsoft, to compare, has bundled CoPilot onto their M365 subscription service and increased pricing, without giving the customer any choice in the matter.)  It?檚 possible uptake will be a bit slow, I guess... but if customers do sign on (and thousands of them already have), Agentforce revenue should only go up as the offering improves and customers learn how to make better use of it.

#####2.	Everyone is using AI agents ??Salesforce isn?檛 doing anything special

All companies are using AI agents already.  Salesforce isn?檛 doing anything special.  They?檙e just trying to pump their stock by building a product that does ?淎I??

**Counter:**  Of course some companies are building AI agents, and they?檒l obviously continue to do so.  But when it comes to workflow automation within Salesforce integrated solutions, all this stuff comes out of the box with Agentforce.  The customer doesn't have to build anything.  Generally, companies do not want to get involved with developing custom solutions for internal processes.

#####3.	Competition from other SaaS Companies

There are other companies in the space working on Agentic AI (ie, ServiceNow, HubSpot).  They may build a better product causing Agentforce to flop.  Salesforce is too old and decrepit to compete.

**Counter:**

* Neither of these companies come close to how entrenched/integrated Salesforce is with Enterprise customers.  It?檚 unrealistic to expect that their products would be so much better, to the point where a major customer chooses them over their existing Salesforce setup.

* Despite being ancient compared to some other SaaS companies, Salesforce regularly releases new major product lines.

* Competitors won?檛 be able to match Salesforce?檚 breadth across segments ??particularly into Enterprise.

#####4.	Agentic AI won?檛 be good enough to replace workers

In the same way that nobody likes the chatbots that show up on websites to help (aka Clippy), Agentic AI will never be as good as a human at getting work done.  Over the next year, customers might decide that Agentforce doesn?檛 work well for them, and simply not use it that much.

**Counter:**

* Customers wouldn?檛 need to have the AI do everything on its own.  Some tasks would be left to humans.  There are plenty of simpler, more transactional tasks, though, that can be automated, freeing humans to spend more time on more complex ones.

* In many cases, I imagine customers would be willing to reduce service quality by 10% if it meant cost savings of 90%.

* It?檚 possible to argue that for some tasks, the AI would actually do a better job than the human.  (No typos, no missed messages, quicker task resolution, etc)

#####5.	Analysts forecast mediocre growth, even in 2026

Revenue growth over Salesforce?檚 FY2026 (which starts in April) is projected at 9%, which isn?檛 great.  While Agentforce might be a quality product, it would be too early to generate meaningful revenue.

**Counter:**  There is no reason to assume Agentforce should take so long to start generating meaningful revenue.

* Agentforce has a tiny sales cycle.  Enterprise customers already have it included in their licensing
* The tool is built into Salesforce.  Some agents can be set up in under an hour.
* With Agentic AI being a trend in 2025, customers should be more eager to implement it.",38,68,1736938445,
Do y?檃ll ever notice how depictions of the far future never seem to have hit the singularity?,"It?檚 a common theme in stories set decades or hundreds of years in the future (like mass effect, Starfield, the outerworlds, and cyberpunk) to be missing so many elements from the singularity. 

These games always show the masses working normal jobs. I guess they have AI and decided not to get labor for cheaper? Also, when AI does exist in these games, it usually isn?檛 super intelligence, it?檚 almost always something of comparable intelligence to humans. Also only recently did they start dabbling in the idea that humans may be nearly immortal someday.

Is it that ideas like superintelligence, immortality, and a fully automated labor market are so hard to imagine that we just don?檛 even try to depict what they?檇 look like? Or are the people making these games aware of what the future would actually hold but just wanna keep the games relatable for people from the present?",167,182,1696619649,
How Are Some People Landing High-Paying Jobs While Many Struggle to Make Ends Meet?,"How are some of you able to find well-paying jobs, especially when so many others are struggling to secure employment that even covers basic expenses? I've noticed that many people are willing to take pay cuts, yet still can't find decent opportunities. I understand that some of you have niche skills that are in high demand, but I believe most people have more generic skills. With outsourcing, automation, and AI, even specialized skills are becoming more widely available.

So, what's your secret for landing multiple jobs, especially remote ones, in a market where many employers demand in-office work? Personally, I was a database administrator, but over the past year, I've struggled to find a job due to personal circumstances and market conditions. I even stopped applying for jobs three months ago because the low pay doesn't justify the costs of relocating, especially for short-term contracts.

I've also applied to the Air Force, hoping to leverage my computer skills, but the recruiting process has been frustrating. Despite the supposed shortage in the military, it took me almost nine months to reach the final stage, a process that should've taken just a couple of months. I suspect this delay might be due to my specific job preferences, race, and age.

I was surprised by how the military, a government entity, operates. I'm concerned about how an 18-year-old would navigate this system, given how difficult it has been for me. If I secure my desired role, I estimate I'd earn around $5,000 to $6,000 after taxes, including various allowances and benefits. This is slightly less than what I earned as a contractor, but the military offers job security.

So, I'm curious: how are you managing to secure multiple jobs? Is $6,000 after taxes a good benchmark for a decent job, or should one expect more? I'm particularly interested in hearing from those who didn't attend top universities but still manage to thrive in this job market.

Additionally, I'm concerned about the direction the job market and economy are heading. Salaries are decreasing due to a larger talent pool, including qualified immigrants willing to accept lower pay. Entry-level positions demand experience, yet offer wages that barely cover basic necessities. Given these challenges, how do you see the future job market evolving? While AI is often blamed for reducing jobs, I feel that outsourcing and cheaper labor are also significant factors.",79,106,1723829018,
"I landed my dream internship, here's my stats and what I learned.","I just landed a Graphic Design & Marketing internship at an NPR affiliated media outlet. ?帀  
  
I used to lurk heavy on this sub while I was job hunting. I was constantly comparing my portfolio to others to see what I was missing and how I could make mine better. I'm super appreciative of everyone sharing their work and websites. So, I wanted to create a quick post sharing my success in hopes it will help a designer break through the hiring wall.

**?彊 My Situation:** I'm pretty blessed to be based in Chicago. I wouldn't have found a job in design easily without proximity to the city. I've *just* graduated from a state university with a Bachelor of Science. I have two *formal* internships under my belt, one studio/library related and one graphic design related. I have one remote volunteer experience with a graphic design archive, and one major magazine project that I also attached to my resum茅. I come from a fine art and studio background, but found a lot of success in Graphic Design. You can view my web portfolio [here](https://www.issgreen.xyz/), and see my resum茅 in the footer of my website. I made it with Google Sites (it's $12/yr) (I'm cheap as fuck).

**?搳 Stats:** It took me 52 days to receive an offer from the beginning of December to the end January. All applications were for Junior & Intern Design positions. One interview was via a connection I made on Instagram (I was rejected). I sent no cold-emails. 

* Applied: 24 (1 application every other day)
   * 18 Junior Positions
   * 6 Intern Positions
* Rejected: 17
   * 1 Personal Email
   * 12 Automated Emails
   * 5 Ghosted
* Interviews: 2
   * 1 Rejection
   * 1 Offer
* Withdrawn: 6

**?摀 Things I learned:**

1. **Quality Over Quantity:** I used to look at people on Instagram and TikTok applying to 100+ jobs within a month. I thought it was stupid... because it is. It became exhausting spam applying to jobs. Instead of sending out 5 low-effort applications that made me feel like shit, I picked jobs I really gravitated towards and sent out 1 well crafted and designed application with a personalized cover letter every other day. Pacing yourself is important.
2. **Use LinkedIn:** Personally, I hate LinkedIn and will never participate in posts nor interact with them. Everything about the platform is so fake and toxic. The bulk of it is garbage AI job advice. Regardless, it is important that you build out a profile so employers can see you and find you quickly. I was passed a couple jobs through there from old professors and classmates, and it does help me keep track of incoming opportunities. Generally, it can't hurt. I won't be using it though...
3. **EasyApply is Horrible:** This should come as no shock. There's nothing human nor personal about sending a job application with a click of a button. Overall I had a way higher response rate with applications sent through job portals and emails other than LinkedIn. Don't expect anything amazing using LinkedIn EasyApply. The one benefit was none of them ghosted, probably because rejecting was also just a click of a button.
4. **Don't Lie:** I'm pretty low income, so I became tempted to lie on my resum茅 to get a job faster because I need the money. The design world appears large on the outside, but as I went to events, studios, and workshops I realized it was much smaller. Even in a larger city like Chicago, the more connections I made the more I realized everyone knows everyone. People talk. Be patient and wait for the right job to come to you, even if you have to work retail to get through it.
5. **Miscellaneous Work:** Most designers I've noticed on this sub and in classes neglect to create a miscellaneous section for all their odd and ends. I *literally* updated my miscellaneous section *the day before* my interview. It ended up being the highlight of the presentation for them. It contained a project, meant to display my ability to work within brand guidelines, that was perfect for their needs. I like to think it secured the job. Just because your project is one deliverable, doesn't mean that its not worthy of showing.
6. **Taking Risks and Niche-ing Down:** I think my portfolio is pretty niche. I have a pretty obvious affinity for publications, books, news, illustration, and some branding and identity. I have some politically motivated projects, as well as some questionable party photography on social media and in my portfolio. It gave me a disadvantage in a lot of corporate agency positions who wanted to see a higher skill variety, less controversiality, and less illustration. I was told in a rejection that the employer didn't want to ""pigeon hold me"" because some of my passions would not see light in the role. On the other hand, it gave me a massive leg up applying for my dream job because the employers saw my work, interests, and career goals directly working with the company not against it. I took a risk, and it was rewarded. I would recommend niche-ing down just a little, showing what you're really interested in, but not so much to the point where you're neglecting other marketable skills some employers would want to see. They make great points of conversation in interviews.

The job market is very much in the shitter right now, I can definitely tell you that much. I know many talented talented friends who are struggling finding work right now. I promise you're gonna make it out, it's very much possible. If you have any feedback on my portfolio it's always appreciated, I'm always looking to improve. Good luck!",137,39,1738743604,
Would You Be Okay Being Jobless If it Meant Lower Status (Even Post-AGI)?,"Let?檚 not kid ourselves here, this sub seems to have attracted many ?渁nti-work??types who hope that AI will free them from their mediocre careers or whatever. And they hope that some sort of UBI system is put in place so that they don?檛 subsequently die of starvation afterwards. 

But one caveat I?檝e always noticed with these types is, they automatically *assume* everyone will be in the same boat as them at the exact same time. They assume that all career fields will somehow be magically automated simultaneously. When in reality, not only will certain jobs be initially hit harder than others??But some industries might collapse much more quickly than others altogether. And whether some of you like it or not, some job fields may **never** see full-on, complete automation. (There will still be at least a small market for genuine human entertainment/interaction even with the future. It is human nature, and will somewhat be reinforced by sexual selection in the future. I can expand on this more if needed, but that?檚 really another topic altogether.)

Therefore this idea that ?渨e?檒l all be jobless together??is just unrealistic thinking. In reality, some people will hang on to their jobs much longer than others. *Even in a world where UBI might be granted*. Those people will quickly float towards the top of society. Meanwhile those that rely solely on UBI will likely slide to the bottom. 

My main question to the Anti-Work crowd here is, are you comfortable with that outcome?

 Keep in mind, this isn?檛 some ?済otcha??question btw. (So don?檛 get overly defensive. ) I?檝e simply noticed that many ?渁nti-work??types seem to have a specific fantasy in their head of how things will play out. Where literally everyone is jobless all at once. (Therefore, avoiding the possibility of an **individual** loss of status, economic freedom or other negative consequences towards the specific individual with low ambition.) But what if it doesn?檛 go that way? I think it?檚 much more likely that those that take the UBI-welfare state lifestyle route, will still fall behind those that don?檛 in some ways. But I?檝e never seen an ?渁nti-work??type address this possibility directly.

It?檚 never simply ?測ay, **I?檒l** be jobless and financially dependent on the government?濃€?it?檚 always ?測ay, **we?檒l all** be jobless and financially dependent on the government equally?濃€?But if that?檚 not the case? Would you still maintain your ?淎nti-work??views if AI created a world where those that *choose* to continue working end up significantly more well-off than those that don?檛? 

Excuse my possible ignorance here I guess. But it just seems like most Anti-work types have this weird ?渁ll or nothing??dichotomy in their heads that makes being rendered jobless perfectly fine in their minds. But it?檚 seems like it?檚 because they are making too many unproven assumptions about what being jobless in the future looks like. What if there?檚 no *equal* utopia even after AI tho? Hell what if there?檚 no UBI even? What if it just becomes a bigger and bigger divide between ?渉ave??and ?渉ave-nots?? Is being jobless and ?渇ree??still appealing to you in that scenario? Or does it have to happen in some ultra-convenient way where there are no negative consequences to you personally?",91,182,1704688855,
Humanity may have crossed a Political Event Horizon,"We cannot coordinate effectively to decelerate...

We?檙e living in a time when AI isn?檛 just a new gadget but a world-changing force. It?檚 moving fast, affecting everyday jobs and global economies. In the past, ?渁utomation??brought to mind factory machines replacing assembly-line workers. Now, AI can write reports, interpret medical scans, and even generate legal documents. Some analysts say as many as 40% of jobs worldwide may be automated, and advanced countries could see up to 60% of jobs affected. This isn?檛 only about robots taking over predictable tasks ??office jobs and creative roles are also on the line.

Yet AI may not simply destroy jobs. Throughout history, new technology has opened up new fields and industries. AI could increase productivity and create higher-skill roles. For instance, many people using AI will find their jobs transformed instead of replaced: they?檒l rely on smart tools to help them code, teach, or analyze data. Studies hint that although millions of positions could disappear, other opportunities will appear, keeping overall unemployment in check *if society adapts quickly*.

The bigger question is whether AI will deepen the divide between the wealthy and the rest. AI might benefit a small group (major tech owners and top-level developers) while leaving those replaced by automation with fewer options and lower bargaining power. Meanwhile, AI can also reduce the cost of previously ?渆lite??services (like specialized medical diagnoses), which might narrow gaps in access. But if countries lack the resources to adopt AI, they may fall behind more developed nations, making global inequality worse. Within each country, giant firms with deep AI research pockets could dominate entire markets.

This rapid shift could upset social stability. If large groups of people feel their jobs vanish or see their skills become obsolete, frustration and unrest might grow. Historically, huge leaps in technology that outrun a society?檚 ability to adapt often fuel protests or even violence. We?檙e already seeing demonstrations among workers in entertainment, customer service, and other fields. If unemployment soars (even in specific regions) some fear entire communities could feel ?渦seless,??leading to widespread anxiety and despair.

Governments are trying to catch up. They?檙e exploring ideas like universal basic income (UBI) to shield people from sudden job loss. They?檙e funding retraining programs so workers can switch careers or learn to work alongside AI. Many are debating shorter workweeks, hoping productivity boosts from AI can let people work less without losing pay. At the same time, new regulations such as the EU AI Act aim to prevent harmful or overly intrusive uses of AI. Other measures, like taxing highly profitable AI ventures or requiring licenses for powerful AI models, are being discussed to ensure the benefits are shared more broadly.

The real challenge is that technology evolves quicker than social and political systems. We?檙e already at a point where AI can handle tasks once thought impossible for machines, and many fear this is just the beginning. Whether AI ushers in a golden era of abundance or fractures society hinges on how quickly we adapt our laws, our economies, and our mindsets. That sense of being on the brink of something vastly different (where old rules may no longer apply) is why many observers say humanity has crossed a ?減olitical event horizon.??The choices we make now will shape whether AI becomes a tool that lifts everyone or a disruptive force that leaves entire groups behind.

"Intel Jones Farm - The Future, Layoffs, and New NSTC EUV Lithography Research Center","**Ok -  here it goes.  To all you Intel folk-**  I have someone inside telling me that Jones Farm is toast.  That message was sent to me in writing 30 days ago. Basically, the message was that the jobs at Jones Farm can be moved and consolidated elsewhere.

Now we know 1,300 have been laid off, and 50% of those layoffs were not at Ronler, but at Jones Farm.  I am researching this market here and where the tech jobs are going.  We all know job losses are coming. The company is in bad shape, but too big to fail.  Jones Farm is an attractive property and location.  But what do any of you that work there or at Intel see happening given all of the changes the company is going through.  Expansions in Arizona and Ohio will be where the Chips get made in mass- it isn't going to be in Oregon.

I also am working in a capacity on the potential NSTC EUV Lithography Center, which is being used as rationale for the Governor to expand the UGB out on Jackson School and US 26.  If it comes it may save Jones Farm and actually be good for that campus and those jobs, or it could eliminate it all together.

Additional thoughts and analysis.

* **Cost-cutting:** Intel has been implementing cost-saving measures, including layoffs and canceling projects (like the sustainable data center lab at Jones Farm). This suggests a focus on maximizing efficiency and prioritizing resources. 聽
* **Consolidation:** Intel might consider consolidating its Oregon operations to reduce overhead and streamline workflows. This could involve shifting resources from Jones Farm to other campuses.
* **Focus on Manufacturing:** Intel's major investments in US manufacturing (like the Ohio mega-fab) might shift the company's focus and resources towards production rather than R&D.

**Factors that** ***could*** **decrease the likelihood of closure:**

* **Importance of R&D:** Jones Farm plays a vital role in Intel's long-term success by driving innovation and developing future technologies. Closing it would significantly impact their ability to stay competitive.
* **Specialized Facilities:** Jones Farm likely houses specialized equipment and expertise that can't be easily replicated elsewhere.
* **NSTC Synergy:** The new NSTC EUV Lithography Research Center could potentially create synergies with the R&D happening at Jones Farm, making the site more valuable to Intel.

**Regarding the NSTC EUV center:**

* **Potential Collaboration:** The NSTC center's focus on EUV lithography, a crucial technology for advanced chipmaking, could lead to collaboration and knowledge sharing with Jones Farm researchers. This could strengthen the case for keeping Jones Farm open.
* **Competition for Resources:** On the other hand, the NSTC center might compete with Jones Farm for resources and funding within Intel.

**Overall:**

It's a complex situation with no easy answers. While cost-cutting is a real concern, the importance of Jones Farm's R&D function and the potential synergies with the NSTC center suggest that Intel might prioritize keeping the site operational. However, the final decision will depend on various factors, including Intel's overall strategy, financial performance, and the evolving landscape of the semiconductor industry.

So what do you all think- what is the future of Jones Farm?  Frankly, the land there is big enough to locate the NSTC EUV LITHO Center on - so that is an option too, I suppose.

Maybe everything is fine, and this is just Gelsinger and Morgan Stanley breaking the company up into pieces to satisfy the stockholders.  Maybe there is more to it than that.

Whatever happens I am pulling for all of you to keep your jobs and for all of us to do better.

To me, AI and automation is the bigger threat to us all.

"30 startup ideas I found after analyzing millions of podcast episodes (w/ problem, solution & source)","Hey,

I've been a bit of a podcast nerd for a long time. Around a year ago I began experimenting with transcription of podcasts for a SaaS I was running.

I realized pretty quickly that there's a lot of knowledge and value in podcast discussions that is for all intents and purposes entirely unsearchable or discoverable to most people. I ended up stopping work on that initial product (party for lack of product/market fit, and partly because podcasting was far more interesting), and focussing on the podcast stuff full-time instead.

Given I'm in this space, have millions of transcripts, and transcribe thousands daily... I've been exploring fun ways to expose some of the interesting knowledge and conversations taking place that utilize our own data/api.

I'm a big fan of the usual startup podcasts (My First Million, Greg Isenberg, etc. etc.) and so I built an automation that turns all of the startup ideas discussed into a weekly email digest.

I always struggle to listen to as many episodes as I'd actually like to, so I thought I'd summarise the stuff I care about instead (startup opportunities being discussed).

I thought you guys would find it interesting to see some of the ideas we've had so far.

They range from being completely whacky and blue sky, to pretty boring but realistic.

Anyone concerned about AI?,"I?檓 a commercial lawyer with a background in software development. I am not an expert in AI but I have been using it to develop legal tools and micro services.

IMO the technology to automate about 50% of legal tasks already exists, it just needs to be integrated into products. These products are not far off. At first they will assist lawyers, and then they will replace us.

My completely speculative future of lawyers is as follows:

Next 12 months:

* Widespread availability of AI tools for doc review, contract analysis & legal research
* Decreased demand for grads
* Major legal tech companies aggressively market AI solutions to firms

1-2 years:

* Majority of firms using AI
* Initial productivity boom
* some unmet community legal needs satisfied

2-3 years:

* AI handles more complex tasks: taking instructions, drafting, strategic advisory, case management
* Many routine legal jobs fully automated
* Redundancies occur, salaries stagnate/drop
* Major legal/tech companies aggressively market AI solutions to the public

3-5 years:

* AI matches or surpasses human capabilities in most legal tasks
* Massive industry consolidation; a few AI-powered firms or big tech companies dominate
* Human lawyer roles fundamentally change to AI wrangling

5+ years:
* Most traditional lawyer roles eliminated
* Except barristers because they are hardcoded into the system and the bench won?檛 tolerate robo-counsel until forced to.

There are big assumptions above. A key factor is whether we are nearing the full potential of LLMs. There are mixed opinions on this, but even with diminishing returns on new models, I think incremental improvements on existing technology could get us to year 3 above.

Is anyone here taking steps to address this? Anyone fundamentally disagree? If so, on the conclusion or just the timeline?

I am tossing up training as an electrician or welder. Although if it?檚 an indicator of the strength of my convictions - I haven?檛 started yet.

TLDR the computers want to take our jobs and judging from the rant threads, we probably don?檛 mind.",84,130,1714257956,
Advice for applicants in the current market,"I graduated in 2023. It took me 7 months to find a job. Found a job in biotech, got miserable, hopped the ship from the lab bench to now as a remote tech worker. 

I now sit as part on the interview panel as we hire for entry level position to our team and I have sat on the interview panel for mid-level position we were hiring for also. I know I have spent my fair share of time on this subreddit and I thought I would contribute back to the community.

Here are some advices/notes/and general thoughts to help you gain insight into the interview process. Note that this really might not apply in larger tech companies like FAANG as I'm speaking from a start-up/mid-sized company perspective. But general principles do apply.

**Biggest Mistakes I See**

* Interviewees are NOT specific about their project or their role or their impact. ""I used R, Python, Java to help automate scripts and conduct EDA"" is **NOT** specific. It's really easy to tell when interviewees are throwing in tech jargons/buzzwords. But we can hear all of that and will still be unimpressed if we do not actually know what **YOU** did
   * ""I scraped data from the NatGeo website and used R to clean up climate data that was ##### of rows/X GBs in size. I utilized Python JupyterNotebook to build X, Y, Z which helped in XXX. I then used Java for YYY. Overall, at the conclusion of this project I was not only able to learn ZZZ but the outcome was HHH. During this process I worked with dev/ops/product team"" **IS** specific
   * The more specific you are about YOUR specific contributions the better
* Interviewees doesn't sound excited about the company. Like come on, we literally had a guy that answered ""well, you guys gave me the interview and the other guys didn't"" when asked ""Why this company"". I cannot emphasize enough how culture fit is extremely important. You could have all the skills and if your future teammates who sat on the interview says ""I don't want to work with this person"", you will not move forward.
   * Candidates that show willingness to learn, eager for opportunities, and genuine excitement about the company generally has better impression on the interviewers
* Mention skillsets on your resume but unable to articulate how you utilized that in your job
   * If you're going to lie, be good about it. Don't say you used extensive statistics on your resume if you struggle to answer what confidence intervals are
* Misunderstand the job. If the job description says this role is a Sanitization Engineer that involves cleaning laundry and you tell us how excited you are to build dishwasher from scratch, low likelihood you will move forward.
   * Understand what the job is asking for. First 3-5 bullets are most important. Everything else is a wishlist/very minor

**Things I notice as an interviewer**

* If you're reading off the screen, its definitely noticeable. Reading off the script is fine but most people are so focused on reading that they come off as robotic, boring, and monotonous
* As a former job searcher that has used every tactic offered on this sub, I definitely notice when people are using those tips and tricks such as ""ask the interviewers as much questions as possible to run the time"". Interviews isn't about filling the time, its about getting to know you. If you're so vague when answering questions, asking interviewers 50 questions during the 40mins left will not help your case
* Using AI to send emails. Come on people lol, you're polluting the environment to ask ChatGPT to write a thank you email? 
* Again, if you're talking just to stall time, just don't. You're only hurting yourself

**Tips for interviews**:

* Show enthusiasm. Does not matter if you have to fake it, please show enthusiasm and your excitement to be here
* Be articulate, tie your experiences together!
* Ask questions about the culture and the team when its your turn
* If you cannot answer a question, don't panic. Simply saying ""I am not sure, but I will look more into this/learn more/etc"" is better than off-screen typing into GPT and saying an answer
* It's okay to say ""that is a good question"" and take a pause before answering, it is not awkward.
* Kindness goes a long way. Once again, culture fit and likability is so important. You can teach someone what confidence intervals is, but you cannot gain a new type of work ethic/personality/aptitude overnight
* Those that are truly eager and interested are generally well-received. I wouldn't apply to an oyster shucking company if I'm passionate about marketing camping gears

**Additional note on resumes:**

* Maybe this is true for FAANG that uses ATS to filter applicants, but there is definitely a real person reading your resume. 
* The format doesn't really matter a whole ton? I've seen resumes that comes in dogwater formats and the most ATS unfriendly layouts that makes it to screening. Just don't make it crazy and make sure its in PDF always
* Keywords in white with 1pt font does not work
* Job titles are quite important, always the first thing I notice
* Please leave your photo out of your resume

I know the job market sucks. I know how helpless you feel, I've been there too. I know the anxiety, stress, hopelessness, uncertainty, and doubting if you're even good enough. Trust me, you're good enough. We received 1,000+ application for an entry level role that was open for 1 week. A big majority of them are people requiring visas or sponsorship that most companies don't really do unless you're FAANG/Fortune 500, so don't be deterred by those Linkedin numbers. 

I wish all of you luck and all it takes is 1 person to say yes to you. I hope that you will find the job that suits you very soon! And hopefully my tips/advice is helpful to some of you at least",250,25,1737531912,
Is it possible to make $5000 per 20 hours/week?,"I work full-time as an electrical engineer. On the side, I've done handyman work, house renovations and corrected general contractor work. I've started thinking about marketing to potential clients seeking specialty work: soundproofing, solar panel installation and smart home technology. 

Example scenario

* Estimate $8k materials/parts, 4 weeks, 20 hours/week (which would total $28k)
* Quote potential client $35k (or 25% higher than estimate)
* 25% down before start; 25% draw halfway; invoice $28k if it takes 4 weeks of labor

This line of business would *not* be focused on repeat customers. For instance, installing a PV field in a residential clients side yard would only happen once. So it's not like I'm continually competing against other contractors.

TMI

1. This idea started back when I got quotes to install a roof. I got quotes from $13k to $33k. The company who $33k must get business. (I'm fairly certain all these roofing companies in my hometown subcontract out. Because whenever I see roofing done, it's nearly always the same Latino men who did my roof in the same blank van with custom rims and ladder rack.) So why am I not having roofing a part of my side business? I would subcontract the work out like everyone else. I just go out to estimate squares and if new gutters and sheathing is needed. 
2. I got a quote to install solar at my house. It was $70k (system, labor and warranty). It didn't occur to me until now... why not try doing marketing for that since their labor rate is so high. Sure, I would have to figure out client financing. And I would have to probably use a virtual assistant from the Philippines or Jobber's AI Receptionist to take calls. But at the end of the day, these specialty jobs pay obscene amounts.
3. There is no one near my 50k population city that does soundproofing or home automation. There must be some potential clients seeking this work.

A March 2020 Scenario For AI,"Like most on this sub, I am blown away by what the current generation of AI is capable of, and struggle to see how my job survives automation for even a few more years. When I bring this up in casual conversation, people who aren?檛 terminally engaged with AI news are still shrugging it off. As someone who had an early freakout about Covid-19 (during late January 2020), this all feels eerily similar.

I figured I would share my hopelessly optimistic (and probably dumb) take for how this might all go down.

Scenario - at some point soon, AI will have its equivalent of the [moment when the NBA canceled its season](https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/30546338/visual-line-day-changed-everything-march-11): some undeniable, mainstream event that forces the public to realize AI is already capable of replacing most white-collar jobs.

The reaction will be immediate and chaotic:

* Mass panic as relatively rich and infuential people realize their careers are obsolete.
* Markets crash as investors model out the second-order effects?攎ass unemployment, collapsing consumer spending, mortgage defaults, etc.
* Elites panic as they realize economic and social instability threatens their wealth, power, and social status.

The alignment of elite and populist political power will lead to an unprecedented government response:

* AI shutdown - seizing data centers, taking personnel from AI companies into custody, locking down GPUs like nuclear centrifuges.
* US-China AI duopoly - both governments agree to a controlled arms race (in which each government controls its AI entirely), but no one else is allowed to play. Cold War II looks a lot like Cold War I in this sense.
* Global enforcement - any third party attempting AGI development faces immediate military intervention.
* A new debate - how much AI should the government allow for commercial use? Do we get ""AI assistants"" or do they keep the real thing locked away? This turns into a more conventional political struggle between interest groups that want to preserve their place in the status quo but still benefit from higher economic growth. The world is changed forever, but life goes on.",14,57,1738947458,
AWS re:Invent 2024 - Keynote Highlights,"Hey folks, we jotted down some notes from the AWS re:Invent 2024 opening keynote, led by Matt Garman in his debut as AWS CEO. If you missed it, here?檚 a quick rundown of the big announcements and features coming in 2025:

* *Compute*

1. **Graviton4:** More powerful, energy-efficient, and cost-effective than ever. Graviton4 delivers 30% more compute per core and 3x the memory compared to Graviton3. It?檚 already helping big players like Pinterest reduce compute costs by 47% and carbon emissions by 62%.
2. **Trainium2 Instances:** Now GA! Boasting 30??0% better price-performance than current GPU instances, they?檙e purpose-built for demanding AI workloads.
3. **Trainium2 Ultra Servers:** For those training ultra-large models, these babies combine 64 Trainium2 chips for 83 petaflops of power in a single node. Anthropic?檚 Project Rainier is leveraging these for a 5x boost in compute compared to its previous setup.
4. **Trainium3 Announcement:** Coming next year, this next-gen chip promises 2x the performance of Trainium2 while being 40% more efficient.

* *Storage*

1. **S3 Table Buckets:** Optimized for Iceberg tables, these offer 3x better query performance and 10x higher transactions per second compared to general-purpose S3 buckets. Perfect for data lakes and analytics.
2. **S3 Metadata:** Automatically generates and updates object metadata, making it easier than ever to find and query your data in real-time.
3. **Cost Optimization:** Tools like S3 Intelligent-Tiering have saved customers over $4B by automatically shifting data to cost-efficient tiers.

* *Databases*

1. **Aurora D-Seq:** A distributed SQL database offering low-latency global transactions, 5-nines availability, and serverless scalability. It?檚 4x faster than Google Spanner in multi-region setups.
2. **Multi-Region Strong Consistency for DynamoDB:** Now you can run DynamoDB global tables with multi-region strong consistency while maintaining low latency.

* *Generative AI & Bedrock*

1. **Bedrock Guardrails:** Simplifies adding responsible AI checks and safety boundaries to generative AI applications.
2. **Automated Reasoning Checks:** Ensures factual accuracy by verifying model outputs mathematically?攃ritical for high-stakes use cases like insurance claims.
3. **Bedrock Agents with Multi-Agent Collaboration:** This new feature allows agents to work together on complex workflows, sharing insights and coordinating tasks seamlessly.
4. **Supervisor Agents** manage dozens (or hundreds!) of task-specific agents, deciding if tasks run sequentially or in parallel and resolving conflicts. For example: A global coffee chain analyzing new store locations. One agent analyzes economic factors, another local market dynamics, and a third financial projections. The **supervisor agent** ties everything together, ensuring optimal collaboration.

# Edit:

* *Data Analytics*

**1. S3 Tables: Optimized for Analytics Workloads**  
AWS unveiled **S3 Tables**, a new bucket type designed to revolutionize data analytics on Apache Iceberg, building on the success of Parquet.

* **Why It Matters**:
   * Apache Iceberg is a leading format for large-scale analytics, but managing it traditionally requires manual maintenance and complex workflows.
   * S3 Tables automate optimization tasks like **data compaction** and **snapshot cleanup**, eliminating the need for customers to schedule Spark jobs.
   * The new buckets offer **10x performance improvements** for Iceberg-based analytics workloads by pre-partitioning buckets and streamlining operations.
* **Features**:
   * Iceberg catalog integration with first-class table resources.
   * Enhanced access control and security at the table level.
   * REST endpoint for seamless query integrations.
* **Performance Gains**:
   * Dramatic reduction in the overhead associated with maintaining large Iceberg tables.
   * An estimated **15 million requests per second** for Parquet files highlights the demand for these enhancements.

**2. S3 Metadata: Accelerating Data Discovery**  
The **S3 Metadata** feature addresses the pain point of finding and understanding data stored in S3 buckets at scale.

* **How It Works**:
   * Automatically indexes metadata from S3 objects, storing it in an Iceberg table for fast querying.
   * Enables users to run SQL-like queries to locate objects based on parameters like file type, size, or creation date.
   * Metadata updates occur in near real-time, keeping queries accurate and up-to-date.
* **Use Case**: Instead of manually building metadata layers, customers can leverage this feature to streamline analytics workflows.
* **Integration**: Works seamlessly with **Amazon Athena** and other Iceberg-compatible tools.
* *Amazon Sage Maker*

1. **SageMaker Unified Studio**:
   * A single development environment for **data discovery** and cross-functional workflows in AI and analytics.
   * Integrates tools from Amazon EMR, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Bedrock, and SageMaker Studio.

"Mass Layoffs, AI Takeover, and India?檚 AI Crisis","As an in-house lawyer in tech/manufacturing, I?檓 seeing firsthand how AI is gutting jobs:

* **Healthcare, IT, Finance:**聽Companies like聽*Gabes Healthcare (Mumbai)*聽axed 200-300 AR/payment roles.聽[*Media.net*](http://Media.net)聽and聽*Ensono*聽laid off hundreds silently.
* **Tech Giants:**聽Google cut Python/Flutter teams.聽Dell fired 12,500 employees聽(10% of workforce) to pivot to AI services.
* **Entry-Level Roles Dead:**聽AI tools like Cursor, Durable, and Suno V3 can code, design websites, and compose music better/cheaper than humans.

# AI Agents ??AGI ??Economic Collapse

* **Unemployment + Inflation = Crime Wave:**聽With 50% of jobs at risk, centralisation of wealth will leave the middle class fighting for survival. India?檚 rupee could hit 100/USD, making essentials unaffordable.

# India?檚 AI Crisis

While China and the US dominate AI/transformer tech, India is聽**centuries behind**:

* **No Homegrown LLMs:**聽Claims of a ??B parameter model??are propaganda. Tools like Hanuman are irrelevant vs. GPT-4 or China?檚 DeepSeek.
* **Government MIA:**聽Politicians are distracted by caste/religious infighting. Meanwhile, India?檚 talent becomes outsourced labor for the West.

# How to Survive

1. **Pivot to AI NOW:**聽Upskill in AI automation, chatbot development, or niche tools. Traditional paths (IIT, IIM, NLU) won?檛 save you. (UPSC might so i guess join this country's favourite pass time)
2. **Escape the Bubble:**聽If stuck in India, consider opportunities abroad. (i dont know how good that will do since AI is a global phenomena)

# Final Warning

Why Is Everyone Switching to Machine Learning & Data Science? Here?檚 What I Noticed.,"I recently met a lot of professionals/students at an event who are working & pursuing their educational degrees. To my surprise, most of them were switching from Software/Non-Software backgrounds to data science and AI.

At first, I thought, *why?* But after talking to them, the answer was clear:

1. AI is taking over & companies are shifting towards AI and automation. Whether it?檚 finance, healthcare or marketing, businesses want data-driven insights and AI-powered solutions. They?檙e looking for people who can work with machine learning, big data, and AI models instead of just writing traditional code.

2 Better job opportunities & many of them feel that software development alone is becoming more competitive. Data science/AI jobs pay more and offer better growth because businesses need AI engineers, data analysts, and machine learning experts more than ever. 

Most software engineers today are expected to know at least the basics of AI & Machine learning. If they don?檛, they risk being left behind.

But here?檚 the problem I felt while talking to them. 

A lot of them are transitioning without a strong math or statistics background. They take AI courses but find it hard because they lack the foundation.

They jump into AI because of the hype but don?檛 know where to start or how deep they need to go. They see job listings requiring Python, TensorFlow, SQL, and cloud computing and wonder how they can learn it faster. 

What does the future hold with the advancement in the field of AI?

I agree that the shift toward AI isn't just hype; it's a real change. Businesses are already automating repetitive tasks using AI tools. It means traditional software jobs writing/debugging code are shrinking. 

But does that mean we don't need devs? Let's dive into a few things I noticed. 

1. Companies expect devs to be AI-aware, even if you are not a master; you are expected to know how automation works. 

2. Software jobs won't disappear. There is a myth that software dev jobs will become redundant in future; it's not true. We need strong front-end and back-end security engineers. 

3. I feel AI is a just a tool, not a replacement; we still need people who understand and hold problem-solving and algorithm skills. AI can write code but can't replace critical thinking. 

In a nutshell, we don't have to be worried about AI taking our jobs; we need to know how it works alongside in Future.",114,31,1740878893,
ROTH IRA: All in on TESLA ,"https://preview.redd.it/iwzq21zymfkd1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311c2c41cc913df1863fd39c03236c1ed7c0964c

**I Believe in the MUSK**

聽

I think Tesla is a highly undervalued play right now, especially in the AI sector.

聽

**Anecdotal Evidence**

聽

I?檓 starting with my own experience of traveling the world and seeing Teslas everywhere. I?檝e been to over 30 states and noticed their prevalence in each one. Beyond the U.S., I?檝e spotted Teslas in countries like Greece, Albania, the Philippines, Korea, and Germany. Even in some of the most remote parts of these countries, Teslas are present. To me, this shows the strength of the brand. Globally, people recognize Tesla as a leading car company, appreciating both its designs and the values it stands for.

聽

**Elon Hate**

聽

Alongside this, there?檚 the fact that Elon Musk?攍oved and hated by many?攊s the face of the company. Whether you like him or not, you can?檛 deny that he?檚 extremely well-known. And as they say, ?渘o press is bad press.??Everyone knows Musk and the cars he represents. Some may argue that his polarizing nature could harm Tesla, but I believe that people ultimately buy good vehicles, and their feelings about the CEO won?檛 stop Tesla?檚 success. Look at other tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Cook, who have faced severe public backlash, yet their companies have continued to grow. Public opinion can change; Zuckerberg, for example, is now seen sporting gold chains and Yeezy clothing. I believe something similar will happen with Musk. Eventually, the dislike for him will either fade or turn into admiration. Don?檛 you want to be part of the Musky baby babe?

聽

**2035 EV Mandates**

聽

Currently, 13 states have EV mandates for 2035 or earlier, and 45 states offer EV incentives. This means that people will have to switch to electric vehicles whether they like it or not. In these states alone, the population exceeds 60 million?攖hat?檚 already 18% of our entire country set to go EV within the next decade, and this number will only grow as more states pass similar laws. Personally, I think people should choose EVs because they?檙e a superior platform to ICE vehicles, not just because of mandates. Having visited several of these states, I can?檛 stress enough how many Teslas I see on the road?攜ou can?檛 drive for long without spotting one. They?檙e everywhere.

聽

**Self-Driving**

聽

We all know Elon has repeatedly promised that self-driving technology would already be here, and I agree it?檚 frustrating. No one really knows when it will arrive. However, no other company is operating at Tesla?檚 level, and it?檚 only a matter of time until they solve the self-driving puzzle. Tesla has over 5 million vehicles constantly running and recording data, with that number only growing. No other automaker is collecting this amount of real-time, global data. Watch current videos of Tesla?檚 latest FSD (Full Self-Driving) version?攜ou?檒l be amazed at how close we are to success. A good YouTube channel to check out is AIDRIVR.

聽

**RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi**

聽

Once self-driving is perfected, RoboTaxi and Robo-Semi trucks will revolutionize the industry. We already know that ride-hailing is a massive business with high demand. RoboTaxis will be able to undercut the cost of human drivers so significantly that most people will choose them 9 out of 10 times. Plus, a new segment of the market will emerge?攑eople who start ride-hailing because of the reduced cost. We?檝e seen the success of companies like Waymo, which has a strong fanbase and continues to grow. Once Tesla nails self-driving and offers a superior service worldwide, it?檚 poised to dominate. The same goes for semi-trucks?攃ompanies will be eager to get their hands on them to comply with 2035 EV mandates, earn tax credits, and reduce costs by eliminating the need for human drivers and all associated expenses. Imagine a world where Optimus robots load a Tesla semi, which then drives itself across the country and is unloaded at another store?攃ompletely automated. I don?檛 think we?檙e too far off from that reality.

聽

**Charging Infrastructure**

聽

Tesla has over 50,000 chargers worldwide, many of which are Superchargers. No other car company has this level of infrastructure and support. This is huge?攐ther companies, like Rivian, are already signing deals with Tesla to use their chargers. Companies will be forced to stay competitive in the EV market. Consumers want to drive long distances; the U.S., for example, is built on the highway system. People don?檛 want to feel limited by their EVs, stuck within city limits, or forced to wait hours for their cars to charge. As people gradually switch to EVs, they?檒l demand the support that only Tesla can currently provide.

聽

**Optimus**

Optimus is still in its early stages, but it signals that Tesla has completed the consumer car phase of its business. Now, they just need to keep producing the S, 3, X, Y models, and the Cybertruck, making them more affordable. With that under control, Tesla has the bandwidth to focus on new ventures?攚here the real gains lie. Tesla can leverage the real-world AI they?檝e been training on driving data and apply it to Optimus. Every company is looking to reduce human labor and automate more tasks. Whether you like it or not, this shift is happening, and it?檚 wise to get on board by owning some stock. Fast food, for example, has been gradually reducing human interaction with touch screens?攎any people now rarely interact with a person. With advancements in AI, robots like Optimus will become a part of our daily lives, running factories and handling repetitive tasks. While this will impact the job market in the short term, people will need to adapt and learn new skills, just like with any major societal shift. I don?檛 see widespread adoption happening anytime soon. I predict that by 2030, Optimus will be working in factories, but day-to-day use is likely at least a decade away. Still, in the long term, I believe it?檚 inevitable.  Imagine a world where Optimus is your wife's bf and you can spend all day gambling on stocks as he takes care of her.

EDIT\*\*

forgot to add this cus im regarded

**Energy Sector**

  
Tesla's energy sector more than doubled its profits since the last quarter, it will continue to grow and eventually outpace the automotive sector. Many people think Teslas is just an automotive company not realizing it's only one piece of the pie and will continue to play less and less into the company's profits. Tesla will eventually be regarded as a name like Apple with many sectors encapsulated under the name. Self Driving, Robots, Energy, etc. 

聽

This is just some bs I wrote up off my dome while slacking at work. My prediction is a 3 trillion market cap by 2030, we shall see. Also, I am a mere regard so this is not financial advice.",0,118,1724427196,

Hello everyone!

I know that we said that we weren?檛 going to be updating the 3.6 ?淥rion??Open Beta branch again, but since the Thanksgiving holidays are coming in the US, I?檝e asked for one last update to be pushed to the open beta branch, with a potential release candidate.

This update should be going up right about now, so you get this week's dev diary a day earlier than usual.

# Release Candidate, does that mean??

Yes, Orion will be released soon. We?檙e currently targeting the 29th of November unless unexpected issues arise from this final (really!) beta release.

(The patch notes are at the end of this post for readability)

# Final Comments on the Open Beta

Due to the incredible success of the Orion Open Beta, we?檙e very likely to do similar releases in the future. Thank you all again for your help - Orion?檚 in much better shape thanks to your feedback.

I intend on pursuing a smaller set of changes for the next one - testing out a limited set of AI vassalization acceptance changes as the next Open Beta, and possibly some economic tweaks.

# So What?檚 Next?

The Canis Minor update will follow Orion in Q1 of 2023, and among other things it will include some of the feedback from the Orion beta that we weren?檛 able to address for 3.6, and further combat adjustments based on live observation.

This includes things such as a rebalancing of technologies to make the Engineering branch less heavy compared to the other two. I?檒l go into the other things planned for the update in the new year.

One of Ptolemy?檚 constellations, Canis Minor is the little dog that follows the hunter Orion.

Meet Tofu, the little dog that follows our QA Director.

That?檚 it for today. Enjoy the release candidate!

**Please note that the 3.6 ""Orion"" Open Beta is an optional beta patch. You have to manually opt in to access it.**

**Go to your Steam library, right-click on Stellaris -> Properties -> betas tab -> select ""stellaris\_test"" branch.**

Reminder: If you?檙e using mods, they?檙e likely to break.

# Changes and additions

The Stellaris 3.6 ?淥rion??update includes many changes to combat. More counters should exist for different strategies, and mixed fleets should be more viable than before, covering for the weaknesses of other ship types.

# COMBAT REBALANCING

* Ship Roles can now be selected to auto-design ships that actually fulfill certain roles, such as Artillery, Brawler, Torpedo, and so on. If you do not possess any weapons that fulfill the selected role, it?檒l do its best with what you have.
* Added a new ship size: Frigates are an advanced form of Corvette specialized in delivering G class weapons.
* Torpedoes now gain a multiplicative damage bonus to their damage based on the ship size of the target, as do Prethoryn missiles. The Unbidden also get a reduced variant of this. This bonus is capped at +800% damage.
* Torpedoes now have a maximum firing arc of 25 degrees and a shorter maximum range.
* Energy Torpedoes such as Proton and Neutron Launchers have been changed into G class weapons with a minimum range. Damage has been adjusted to be balanced as a Torpedo class weapon, and like the new Torpedoes, they deal increased damage to larger targets. Unlike standard torpedoes, they remain instant hit weapons for now.
* Some sources of Evasion have been replaced with other effects.
* Small weapons of a category now have a slightly faster refire rate, Large weapons of a category now have a slightly slower refire rate.
* Added a minimum range to all Large weapons except Lasers.
* Weapon component tooltips now display minimum range and firing arc.
* Significant adjustments have been made to various ship combat behaviors.
* Ship combat computers now ignore certain weapons for desired range purposes, and base their desired distance on the actual loadout of the ship. ""Swarm"" and ""Torpedo"" behavior will charge in, ""Picket"" and ""Line"" behaviors will attempt to stay at the range of their median range weapons, and ""Artillery"" and ""Carrier"" will try to stay at the range of their longest ranged weapons.This generally increases the desire for ships to remain at range if possible.
* Artillery and Carrier combat computers now use the new maintain\_range combat behavior, which attempts to back off if at less than roughly half their desired range.
* Strike Craft no longer intercept missiles, but will continue to fight each other. Reduced the health and refresh rate of most strike craft.
* Flak Batteries now more strongly counter Strike Craft, while Point Defense now more strongly counter missiles and torpedoes. Strike Craft are more reliant on Shields, Missiles and Torpedoes are more reliant on Armor. Due to their ability to bypass shields, Strike Craft are very effective against other Strike Craft.
* Added Armor Hardening and Shield Hardening modifiers, which reduce armor and shield penetration. Added new aux components that use Exotic Gases, Rare Crystals, Living Metal, or Zro to provide armor and shield hardening.
* Autocannons now have a faster fire rate (and thus are very high damage for their weapon size, but have very short range).
* Added Medium and Large Autocannons.
* Disruptors and Autocannons are now considered Brawling weapons, with short range but faster attacks.
* Mining lasers are now classified as Brawling weapons. Refire rate and general stats have been adjusted.
* With the exception of Autocannons, Kinetic and Missile weapons no longer have bonus hull damage.
* Lasers now deal 25% bonus hull damage.
* Increased the power consumption, cost, and damage of Plasma weapons to differentiate them more from other energy weapons.
* Ships now get a limited number of disengagement opportunities. All current drives provide 1 disengagement roll once the ship takes hull damage below its disengagement threshold, and the Hit and Run war doctrine grants all of your ships an additional attempt. Civilian ships set to evasive will continue to try to disengage with each hit.
* The Hit and Run doctrine provides +2 Disengagement Opportunities.
* Admirals now grant their fleet +1 Disengage Opportunity at levels 5 and 10.
* The Enigmatic Encoder now proves +1 Disengagement Opportunity rather than evasion.
* Armor components now grant twice as much armor as before. Shield components now grant +50% more than before, but regen remains the same. Hull components grant less than before.
* Hull Technologies now give 10% hull instead of fixed values.
* Armor and Hull regen now behave like shields - five times faster outside of combat. (Regen values are now 20% of the previous values for most components.)
* Missiles now fit into S weapon slots and have had their damage modified accordingly, Swarmer Missiles go into M. Torpedoes (and Proton/Neutron Launchers) are now the only weapons that fit into the G slot.
* Adjusted the maximum range of all non-torpedo missiles. Reduced the range of torpedoes. Decreased Missile Accuracy from 100% to 85%.
* Made XL weapons more likely to target battleships and titans.
* Massively increased the chances to lose or damage ships when a fleet uses emergency FTL to escape a battle.
* Reduced the time before emergency FTL can be initiated during combat.
* Ships should try to spread out a little further away from one another in combat.
* Ion Cannons now have 3 Aux slots. The Destroyer (Interceptor), Cruiser (Gunship), and Battleship (Broadside) stern sections now have an extra Aux slot.
* Adjusted power costs for Aux slot utilities.
* It is no longer possible to kill a dragon by distracting it with a large fleet of transport ships.
* The cap to the Force Disparity bonus for fleets that are significantly outnumbered has been dramatically increased.

# FEATURES

* Reworked the Ascension Paths from Utopia into tradition trees.
* Added a version of the Synthetic ascension path for machines to Synthetic Dawn.
* Added Conclave Federation Election type to Federations.
* Added Ascensionists civic to Utopia for regular empires and equivalents for hives and machines. Provides +25% planetary ascension effects, -10% ascension cost, and reduces the additional cost of traditions from empire size by 25%.
* The Epi-Genetic Triggers technology and Genetic Resequencing tradition now both allow the removal of pre-sapient traits from species via species modification. The Servile trait from the Syncretic Evolution origin and traits bestowed by the Enigmatic Cache count as pre-sapient traits for this.
* Added various new galaxy shapes, such as 3 and 6 arm spirals, and some more experimental and irregular shapes.
* Galaxies now default to Spiral (2-Armed) rather than Elliptical. Tiny Galaxies now support Spiral (2-Armed) galaxies.
* Added an archaeology site in a new solar system with a debris belt.
* Added support for Text To Speech in various views containing longer texts.
* Added the Cordyceptic Drones civic to Necroids for hiveminds, allowing them to reanimate all organic space fauna..
* Added an event on game start with Common Ground origin to let you pick your federation type.
* Implemented new event chains.

# IMPROVEMENTS

* AddedRolled Slave Revolt content into the general Separatist Revolt Situation as a variety when slaves try to revolt.
* Added ""planet revolt"" VO to planetary revolt situation
* The habitability planet icons in the system view can now be clicked just like on the galaxy map.
* Added a Planet Automation setting which allows for construction even during resource deficits.
* Added tooltip for Detox saying how many Toxic Terraforming CandidatesTCs existyou have within your borders.
* Machine name lists now use hexadecimal and 0-based sequential names.
* Made auto-migration happen via weighted random (so the destination planet will be algorithmically chosen from among the valid destinations, rather than pops always favoring a certain planet until it is full even when multiple are available).
* Changed how Planet Automation is presented in the Planet View to more clearly show that there are settings available.that the player can use.
* Planet Automation Crime Management will now forbid enforcer jobs if you have 0 crimes and allow enforcer jobs if you have more than 27 crime.
* The tooltip for planetary automation designation setting now explains when it will create new jobs.
* Added a new event image for reanimation related events
* Added the Parasitic Overmind Government type.
* Explicitly prevented various scripted solar systems from spawning inside Marauder territory. These include Amor Alveo, Wenkwort, the Caravaneer capital, and Lost Colony origin systems.
* Delayed the start of precursor events for empires with the On the Shoulders of Giants origin. Players who are busy exploring their own backstory may begin exploring those of the broader galaxy after completing the 'Intercepting History' event chain, at which point Precursor events are 3x more likely to appear.
* Habitats built in orbit of large zro, alloy or dark matter deposits now also collect these deposits.

# BALANCE

* Occupied planets no longer produce or consume resources from buildings or pops.
* Added nanite autocannons and flak cannons as a reward for killing the scavenger bot.
* The Aquatic trait now costs 2 points.

* The Logic Engines trait is now allowed on droids.
* Tweaked Galactic Market location formula to far more strongly favor trade value in its criteria.
* Capped Federation Experience at 2000 above what is required for level 5, so that level 5 federations with AIs are no longer one of the most fragile configurations known to man.
* If a species cannot live on a planet, it is now the first to be purged from it (this closes a Clone Army exploit related to slowly purging other species instead).
* Artificers now no longer produce engineering research.
* Made Zro Distillation more likely to appear if you have a Shroudwalker teacher.
* Pearl Divers have had their CG output increased, with a corresponding increase in food/mineral upkeep. Their trade value output has been reduced.
* Splinter Hive holdings now require at least 30 pops present on the subject planet to be constructed.
* The Toxic Entity now has an acidic gland dealing 1.25% hull damage per day to all ships in the same system. This does not apply to the player controlled variant.
* A large number of tweaks to the ethic assignment weights. Includes making certain weights based on diplomacy with empires of a particular ethos have an impact that is more dependent on the number of empires you are engaged in such diplomacy with.
* Fixed some oddities that hampered authoritarianism, e.g. now relations with authoritarian empires boosts authoritarianism, and if you are authoritarian, it will no longer boost egalitarianism for you to give your pops good living standards. Finally, also added some weights based on the job the pop is actively working (e.g. priests, nobles and soldiers)
* Certain technologies are no longer cheaper than other technologies in the same tier.
* Food Processing Centers, Mineral Purification Hubs, Energy Nexuses, Alloy Nano-Plants, Civilian Repli-Complexes, The Auto-Curating Vault, Citadel of Faith, Corporate Vault and Alpha Hub now have increased cost and upkeep on ringworlds, in exchange for providing the benefits normally giving by their related orbital ring buildings.
* Ringworld colony designations and ecumenopolis planet class now provide both mechanical and organic pop assembly.
* Colony designations on ring worlds now provide +10% pop growth and assembly speed (this can be multiplied through planetary ascension). The default ""ring world"" designation provides +15%
* Ecumenopolises now give +25% growth and assembly speed, rather than +50% growth (and no assembly)
* Efficient Bureaucracy civic now grants Bureaucrats, Priests, Managers and Death Priests with Edict Fund production that scales with modifiers to their Unity production.
* Imperialist and Supremacist factions will now be pleased forever if you defeat a Leviathan, not just for 20 years. They are also a bit less selective about which Leviathans they are pleased about you killing (i.e. the list has been updated for those added since the Leviathans DLC)
* Several factions now care about the type of federation you are in, if it is one attached to a particular ethic
* The Imperialist faction will now care about how much of your fleet power you are using.
* Factions will now disband and not reform if they can command the support of less than 3% of the electorate.
* Halved the culture worker modifiers for Egalitarians, Xenophobes and Xenophiles.
* Doubled the culture worker modifier for Pacifists.
* Increased the time it takes to do first contact with other civilisations by about 30%.
* Slightly increased the chance of having a unique first contact event chain.
* It is now allowed for the galaxy to contain multiple void dweller empires.
* Moved the repeatable technologies for strike craft into Society - Military Theory.
* Reduced governing ethics attraction of newly-conquered pops.
* Removed defense platform cost and upkeep reductions from Bulwarks. Bulwarks now gain inherent shield and armor hardening as they level up.
* Strategic resource planetary automation will no longer fill fortress designation planets with refineries instead of strongholds.
* Subjects that are not disloyal will now gain ethics attraction corresponding to their overlord's ethics (this was already the case for spiritualism, now it is the case for all ethics).
* The Cybrex and Sentinel factions now scale to a limited degree based on the setting for endgame crisis difficulty (their difficulty = square root of crisis difficulty).
* Martial Law, Hunter Killer Drones and Compliance Drones planet modifiers now provide penalties to both mechanical and organic pop assembly.
* Zro distillation technology no longer explicitly requires Psionic Theory, but is extremely rare without it.
* Buffed the daemonic incursion by giving them additional naval capacity, reduced ship upkeep and many more fleets (scaling off of their naval cap).
* Updated Merc and Salvager station designs due to changes in which weapons could fit in which slots.
* Extradimensional Anchors and Portals now have a shield hardening aura for allies in that system.
* Larger Extradimensional ships and structures now have a point defense solution. Bzzt.
* Special endgame crisis factions such at the Aberrant, Cybrex and Sentinels now show up a bit earlier on large galaxy maps.
* Presapient traits now have no trait point or trait pick cost.

# Ascension Paths:

* Assimilation tooltips now state if they will remove psionic or cybernetic traits.
* You can now psionically awaken cyborgs. Doing so removes any cybernetic implants they have.
* Installing cybernetic implants in a psionic species now prevents them from having any psionic abilities.
* Non-hive-mind cybernetically ascended empires can now remove the hive-mind trait from hive-minded cyborg pops by assimilation.
* The budding trait is no longer mutually exclusive with the vat-grown trait. The polymelic trait is now mutually exclusive with all versions of the budding traits.
* Rebalanced the Cyborg, Erudite, Psychic and Synthetic leader traits.

# AI Opinions:

* Dramatically increased the absolute value of most opinion modifiers.
* Increased the opinion modifiers granted from first contact, decreased the base rate at which they decay and made the decay rate modified by improving/harming relations.
* Increased the opinion penalty for undertaking Become the Crisis.
* Maximum opinion from Improve Relations has been increased to 150. Minimum opinion from Harm Relations has been decreased to -150. Previous values were 100 and -100 respectively.

# Origins:

* Mechanists: Now provides +15% robot assembly speed and +1 robot trait pick as origin modifiers instead of -5% robot upkeep. The starting robots now have the bulky and high maintenance traits and the matching trait for whichever worker job they hold. Finally, they now have Robomodding as a guaranteed research option from the start of the game.
* Shattered Ring: The number of segments that are colonizable on game start now depends on the Guaranteed Habitable Worlds setting. These segments have a large amount of blockers including some that require advanced technology to clear, but impact the habitability of the segment. Shattered Ringworld segments are no longer ideal worlds, but have a base of 100% habitability. Repairing shattered ringworld segments now qualify you for the Galactic Wonders AP. The cost and time to restore the shattered ringworld segments has been reduced by 25%.
* Corpse-Filled blockers now take a year to clear.

# AI

* AI will now value you offering them fleets. This fixes several cases where you could cheese the AI with worthless offers (e.g. fleets that you have just disbanded, or fleets that have no FTL drive, or are 100% of your total fleet despite being just 1 ship)
* Added base unity target for machine empires so they can afford more leaders in the early game.
* AI assault transports will now go ahead and invade planets if they have enough strength even if they have additional reinforcements on they way.
* AI will no longer assign excessive amounts of fleets to bombard the same planet.

* AI will now build armies based on the size of their economy.
* AI will now correctly avoid superior enemy forces when pathing to link up with their fleet group
* AI will now use war time edicts, and pay for their strategic resource from their stockpile without constructing additional rare resource producing buildings.

* Reduced UI frame rate lag from several sources (notably related to fleets and calculations of whether and where any reinforcements can be recruited)
* Further improved the performance of using triggered economic category modifiers.
* Made mean time to happen events early out if they have fire\_only\_once and have already fired. (I.e. they will stop draining performance once no longer relevant).

* Added caching to AI fleet power calculations.

# UI

* Added terraforming candidate icon to galaxy map and system view.

* Expansion planner view now has ahave Terraforming Candidate filter. which will help the player to find the uninhabitable planets which has potential to be terraformed to habitable ones. Also there is new status icon which will help distinguish the planets which are possibleis possible to terraform from the ones that are notis not. (not owned, tech requirements, etc...)
* First Contact event chains will now progress if there is a purely random event with only one option. (Note that this only covers events between stages, not the ones that end stages, which may also only have one option). You can tell if your first contact chain is not blocked by a pending event by the alert looking less urgent.because the alert icon will look a bit less threatening.
* Fixed the tooltip for commercial pacts showing the wrong value for how much you would benefit in terms of trade income.

My 2025 - 2026 Predictions,"* By Jan 2025: GPT5 / Orion is announced, demonstration wows everyone but it is not yet released. Demo shows the next step in scale combined with the reasoning abilities of o1. Demo focuses on showing highest possible level of reasoning / intelligence ability, not flashy interface toys like vision or audio. A few more benchmarks become saturated and even difficult benchmarks e.g. Simple Bench will begin to show metric distributions that overlap slightly with the lower end of human performance in some categories. 
* By May 2025: Its clear OpenAi and Google are putting a lot of effort into laying the groundwork for agents. This can be seen by multiple UI upgrades allowing deeper integration between models and your device. For example, Screen sharing / vision becomes available for gpt-4o. 
* By August 2025 GPT5 / Orion is released and is available to both plus and enterprise users. With this release OpenAI raises prices from 20$ a month to 25$ a month. This new model initially will only have the standard text interface we are familiar with as it is for o1 today. gpt-4o however will still be receiving upgrades and will serve as the testbed and initial release point for agent capabilities. By this point gpt-4o will not only have advanced voice mode / vision available but will also be able to directly perform actions on your device. You will be able to whitelist / set permissions for specific apps / actions that the model is allowed to take. This will start a paradigm where OpenAI releases new text only models that push the limits of reasoning alongside smaller cheaper models with less safety concerns which push the boundaries of user interfaces. 
* By September 2025 the first commercially viable humanoid robot demo takes place at a small scale in a few factories in the US. The robots are still not productive enough or cheap enough to economically viable at scale but their capability to do the work is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In typical Elon style tesla makes a massive bet on Optimus and starts an insane production line build out to try and capture market share by selling Optimus to US manufacturers to use at a loss. 
* By November 2025 OpenAI begins relaxing guardrails around NSFW content and guidelines around ""strictly professional user interactions"". The ship of unhealthy(depending on your opinion) human ai relationships will already have sailed with open source models by this point. Slowly but surely people will notice the models being willing to engage in previously blocked conversation topics. This follows Sam's philosophy of slowly releasing capabilities as early as possible to allow society to adjust. Public debate about long term effects / harms of human AI relationships and privacy concerns take center stage. Memory capabilities will have also improved allowing the models to better remember details about you.
* By Jan 2026 the next flagship model will be confirmed to be in training. By now OpenAI will have entirely moved away from the ""GPT"" naming scheme for future models. Almost all the multimodal capabilities previously seen only in gpt-4o will now begin to be released for GPT5 including the ability to reason over the multimodal input. People will now notice that all flagship models refuse to assist in solving AI research questions as frontier labs begin to fear they might help competitors catch up. This causes some outrage from the academic community and somewhat revitalizes open source research efforts. Around this time is when major job losses to AI will become undeniable. With multimodal capability fused into GPT5, call center workers / customer support personnel will find their jobs disappear within a matter of a few short months. This will bring AI related job losses into the political realm just in time for the 2026 midterm elections. It will become a major political battleground topic going forward. 
* By March 2026 open source models will have caught up with voice mode performance of GPT-4o from mid 2025 leading to an explosion in identity theft, scams, fraud. Panic grips popular media as it becomes clear many of the ways we previously verified our identity can now be worked around. Identity protection and AI regulation also becomes a major political topic for the midterms and the legal system and security industry races to patch holes.
* By April 2026 AI proliferates across devices. Around this time we will see usage of AI be commonplace not just from computers and mobile phones but also from the next version of AR / VR glasses like the next apple vision device or meta. The devices by now will be good enough to go mainstream. Between AI enabled security cameras, ar / vr glasses, mobile devices etc... In very few major cities in the developed world will you be able to exist in public without your every move being watched, interpreted and tracked by an AI. Vicious battles about how AI should exist in relation to the legal system / privacy will be in full swing. 
* By May 2026 it becomes clear that the bottleneck in terms of further proliferation of AI is not so much model capability but inference compute limits. Frontier labs will be eager to hoard all their compute for training / research on the next frontier model to stay ahead and therefore will have limited compute left to scale inference servicing to the max. Users will struggle with rate limits, higher priced tiers for more use time etc...
* By July 2026 the first economically useful humanoid robots are seen doing repetitive tasks in factories around the US. Around 5000 humanoid robots are working across the us in factories. At this point the US is undergoing a manufacturing boom and there is a major labor shortage. Ramping up humanoid robot production is seen as a solution. Others claim that fired white collar workers should retrain to work in manufacturing but the social perception of that being a step down the socioeconomic ladder causes major social backlash and little to no movement from white collar to manufacturing work for laid off workers. 
* By August 2026 the next OpenAI flagship model is announced. This model is still fundamentally in the GPT5 class of intelligence but has now begun to be explicitly trained on agentic longer context tasks using reinforcement learning. This model will be able to not only think for seconds like O1 but will be able to perform sequences of several actions that may span minutes. Even hours long tasks are theoretically possible but the model is very unreliable over such long time horizons. 
* By October 2026 a large scale government subsidized build out of data centers and energy production is underway. Policy makers under pressure from the business community now finally realize how critical sufficient compute capacity is to maintain American economic competitiveness. Nuclear power regulations are slashed. SMR reactors boom in popularity. Multiple frontier labs race to place orders for SMRs to feed the latest generation of NVIDIA gpus. Fear grips the national security consciousness in the US that China might surpass us in AI. It becomes a sort of new cold war space race from here on out. 
* By December 2026 with the latest long time horizon agentic model being released the next round of job losses drops. Companies realize that repetitive white collar work like data entry / making presentations / administrative tasks can all be done automatically or with minimal supervision from a small number of senior team members. Companies rush to replace these workers leading to initial panic. It however quickly becomes clear that inference compute has not yet scaled to the point where all these workers can be replaced. Some companies are forced to hire back workers they just fired when they cant buy enough inference compute or they are overzealous with their automation and it doesnt totally work. However this still results in enough job losses to cause a noticeable spike in white collar unemployment leading to lower wages.",83,70,1728963579,

I fell into the builder's trap and need help getting out,"Hi r/startups,

First-time technical founder here. Two years ago, I decided to leave the 9-5 grind and build something meaningful. Now, I have (what I believe is) a brilliant technical solution but no clear business case. I?檓 seeking a cofounder with product and marketing expertise to help pivot my project into a viable business - or start a new one. Details below.

**About Me**

* 36yo, born in Berlin and moved to San Francisco 8 years ago
* Master's in Software Engineering with 15 years of experience
* Worked with early-stage startups in Berlin and a venture studio in SF
* Spent the past years leading a team of 12 shipping enterprise software 

**The tech I've built**

An AI engine that makes it easy for developers to automate their workflows. It works with code, issues, PRs and integrates with 3rd party systems like error trackers, wikis, ticketing systems, etc. It takes natural language instructions, fulfills them autonomously and responds with a result. The functionality is served as a platform, with an API and an SDK. On top of it, I've built a CLI and a web application with productivity tools for developers.

**Who and what I'm looking for**

My main goal is to leave my current job and build a company around a problem that matters to me, ideally with considerable equity. I?檓 looking for:

* **A cofounder** with product and marketing expertise who sees potential in my tech and can help turn it into a successful business?攐r someone with a strong business case who needs a technical founder.
* **Mentorship** from someone experienced in dev tool startups or as a successful solo founder. I?檇 love to learn from your journey and would be happy to offer my technical expertise or collaborate on projects in return.

Nakakapanibago ang freelance market and community,"I?檝e been in and out of freelancing for over 6+ years and recently I have been peeking sa market and community and I noticed that there are some scary differences from how some freelancers think back then and now.

back then, developing your niche and identity to be set apart from others was the formula to get client leads. This entails prepping up a cool portfolio, website, service structures and packages, etc. Marketing yourself like a business offering your expertise.

Now, some freelancers I see are positioning themselves like an employee rather than a service provider. which was weird to me, siguro they are after the higher pay lang pero not in the mindset to be the ?渆xpert service provider??
Another funny thing pa was the blatant disregard for a portfolio pero garapal maglagay ng self-made titles sa sarili. 3 months ago on a totally different field, got a certificate now they?檙e an ?渆xpert??lmao HAHAHAH PS. not to hate or gatekeep but to give an advice na magbuild kayo ng extensive portfolio and be honest about the extent of your expertise para di mapahiya in the end. Fake it till you make it responsibly please kasi kapag hinayaan yung ganyan, the market will be saturated by incompetency, which will in turn, ruin the credibility of the ph freelancing community.

Also, protect your niche! #AhonPinoy #MagkabalikatAangat is a scam. If you find a profitable niche, protect it with your life. if it gets saturated, your own job market will suffer. If you let others in, you?檙e basically inviting them to be your competitor. If you?檙e gonna network, be with someone that?檚 only complimentary to your niche as that?檚 where referrals are gonna come from. 

but yeah, maybe this is a stupid take since I?檝e been out sa freelancing na and baka iba na panahon ngayon but I hope everyone finds their path to success. Kayod lang!

Prediction for the Future (Agents will create 90%+ Layoffs within the next 3 Years),"As AI agents continue to improve, major AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Claude will likely roll out their own **AI Employee Programs**. Here's how it might work: These programs will offer AI with capabilities as good as?攐r better than?攁 large percentage of white-collar workers.

Companies will be approached with a proposal to secretly deploy an **AI Observer**. This AI will monitor employee workflows, job responsibilities, and performance remotely for 3-6 months, creating a detailed map of every function within the organization. Once the AI fully understands these roles, it will be able to identify top performers and underperformers.

At that point, with the flip of a switch, companies will have the option to replace up to 90% of their workforce, keeping only a handful of top employees to oversee quality control, handle advanced tasks, or provide creative strategy.

When this ""Observer-to-Employee"" model gets adopted by major corporations, we could witness a massive shift?攚hat many will perceive as a bloodbath in the job market. Those who understand business, AI, and tech can already see the writing on the wall.

The solution is to find a way to build a moat around yourself. Build a personal brand, learn entrepreneurship, pursue careers in hard-to automate fields, level up skills to align with AI. I don't say this to fear monger but because it's coming, winter is almost here and those who are prepared will be okay and those who aren't will be left in the cold.

"Some artists won't be able to adapt, and that's fine. They will make money some other way","Much like the people who owned DVD rental stores.

A lot of the AI debate is focused on image/video generators, which I do think offers a better path for people to be able to adapt in the free market and learn to do the things the computer doesn't know how to do yet and make money with that. The whole thing about automation is learning to do whatever the machine doesn't know how to do yet, because ultimately, somewhere in the future it will be able to learn how to do everything humans can do.

With that said, there are a lot of other art-related jobs that I don't see being that adaptable to this new technology. To give an example, book narration and dubbing actors and actresses, it's a set of skills that I don't see being adaptable that easily. Like, your skills were essentially that you were able to talk pretty well and to interpret characters. Can you morph those skills into something else? Sure, maybe a dubbing actor could become a theatre actor, but I feel this is a really big jump *(an even bigger jump than an illustrator, who already uses digital software, to start using Flux/Stable Diffusion and to incorporate AI into their workflow)*.

I have been playing a little with 11Labs text-to-voice generation (which, by the way, they released a free app for Android and iOS), and I would be surprised if in the next 5 to 10 years the norm in the industry isn't just using synthetic voices to do this. It's not perfect yet and if you compare with the best narrator or the best dubbing actor, they will most likely be able to do a better perform. But, it's already better than many narrators and dubbing actors, and... this is the worst this technology will ever be.",6,112,1724177952,
"Tesla Bot: Musk unveiled a humanoid robot design today, and he used it as an argument for UBI. The economic ignorance is rampant and isn't going to get better...","First of all, let this be the death of people calling Musk in any way a libertarian figure.

Second of all, here is the robot concept, which is literally just a render in a slideshow with no actual hardware shown at all, just Musk they'll be able to complete it next year some time.

[https://electrek.co/2021/08/19/tesla-bot-humanoid-robot/](https://electrek.co/2021/08/19/tesla-bot-humanoid-robot/)

Here is a synopsis video of the event in just a couple minutes:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsbgCPOW1HQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsbgCPOW1HQ)

Musk then goes on to say that the economy is at root about labor (ugh), and that one day manual labor will be an optional thing. Now on that last score he's right, because robotics will eventually be able to do all manual labor jobs, but that does not mean that all work in the economy is manual labor. And it sure as hell does not mean that we need UBI.

He thinks these robots (likely vaporware for several years) will be able to do things like use a wrench to change a tire, or go to the store and buy X groceries (would you tell a $100k robot to go to the store alone).

What's more, the economy is already highly mechanized. We all don't do repetitive manufacturing work, only high variable work in factories where humans excel and robots do not. But Musk assumes that AI will soon become powerful enough to change that.

And let's say he's right about that. If you're a business owner, do you hire a human being for say $3000 that month, or do you outlay $100k for a machine that can maybe do it as well as a human being but probably not.

Machines aren't going into people's homes on day one, they are trickling down from the top. If you have a robot, you want it to help do the most valuable work in the economy. That's why we have machines that help with brain surgery, and expert AI systems that help doctors perform diagnoses.

As for UBI, it's nothing more than a welfare scheme and completely incompatible with a democracy. Obviously such a program would be VERY politically popular, the masses never vote away free money, they will instead vote for billions and billions more:

> The problem is that the program must be financed somehow. Let us assume for simplicity that there are 250 million adult Americans and that each of them would receive $1,000 monthly ([as presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposes](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/)). So we get a total cost of $250 billion monthly and $3 trillion annually. It would amount to about 14 percent of US GDP, or 42 percent of total government spending, or 73 percent of the federal outlays. For comparison, this is more than the total expenditure on health care, defense, and education. And yet we are talking about ?渏ust??$12,000 annually (or 19 percent of the median household salary, or 36 percent of the median personal income). Good luck with such an expensive program!

> No one doubts that robots, software, and automation eliminate some need for human labor where adopted. But the automation doomers' scenario assumes that聽when jobs are eliminated by automation in one place, that number of jobs are permanently gone. For this to be true, there would have to be no compensating growth in the need for labor elsewhere.   
>  
> These two arguments turn out to be related through [Say?檚 law](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Say%27s_law). This is the name we give to the observation that聽when a producer supplies a good, their action constitutes a demand for a different noncompeting good.

"I think this post will be monumentally important for some of you to read. Put it in your brain, think about it, and get ready for the next few years. If you are part of this Subreddit; You are forward thinking, you're already ahead of the curve, you will have one shot to be at an advantage. NOW.","First of all, sorry if I come off so matter-of-fact. And sorry if this feels like a crack-pot, wannabe prophet post that can be common around here. I realize my title sounds like click-bait, but I seriously feel strongly about this, and I assure you the full read is worth considering. Long post incoming.

**2023 will almost certainly be the year we see the beginning of truly Transformative AI.** I say that, because well, I'm rounding up, **it's already here at the end of 2022**. However, it's not quite up to the task yet, we need the next generation of LLM to drop before us commoners will be able to take full advantage. *Start using chatGPT if you haven't already. Give characterAI some focus of your time.* If you have played around with them, *keep going back*. Start trying to incorporate it into things you do in your day to day. It won't be able to complete every task you ask of it, but you need to learn this now.

\_\_\_

A lot of us remember learning how to properly construct a Google search. Using quotation marks, adding 'site:' followed by the exact page you want results for, setting the time frame for specific results or to push past SEO and get the most recent results for your research. Things like that put you leaps ahead of most people using a search engine. The skill gap of the internet is actually quite vast today. Insiders and experts have been regurgitating this ""*AI will change the way we access the internet*"" line in several talks and videos now. *What does that mean* though?

In the beginning I imagine it will be simply typing a question to an AI and it outputting the best and most concise answer for you, kind of like talking to chatGPT right now. As anyone that's used these AI so far knows, prompting is important. Same deal with getting images made from Text to Image models, it's almost like an artform itself, getting the prompts perfect.

This won't last long though, prompting ""exactly"" will go away, and that vast skill gap of using the internet will become much narrower. There will most likely be a time frame in the next year or 2 of an absolute gold rush in using AI when prompting starts to become simpler and less precise. I'm not necessarily talking about creating and training an AI yourself, though if that's something you think you can do then more power to you. *I'm talking about those of us that are average people, that want to get ahead in life before the inevitable AI automation revolution.*

Say you have a hobby, let's say something like wood working. You make wooden spoons. You might only make them for fun, but it would be cool to sell them online. How much would someone pay for it? How much do you need to make per spoon so it's worth your efforts? Do you have a bunch of wooden spoons already lying around? There will be a **short** period of time to corner the online wooden spoon market with AI. Sure, other wooden spoon makers will come along after, but wouldn't you rather be one of the first?

How will AI help? You ask it how to cut and finish a luxury yet affordable wooden spoon, you ask it how much to sell it for to make a profit and how much people will likely pay for it, you take photos of it. You send the photos to the AI, it recreates the photos to look professional and it builds a website for you, then you're selling within an hour. You ask it how to market your spoons. You ask it to write your business statement.

\_\_\_

Now of course that's just an example, and it could go many different ways in the near future. However the point is keep your eyes open, and your ear to the ground. Get on board early, hit the market fast with your own innovations. Perhaps you will be able to make a 2023 version of a stupid game like flappy bird and make some serious money. Maybe you'll get a promotion at the tech company you work for and work directly with the State of the Art, and be an irreplaceable asset for years to come. Who knows, you could create a new social media company that takes off because it's what the world has been yearning for. Or, maybe you'll just get an investment in early and pad your savings account. All of these may be plausible or maybe they're way off base. But the writing is on the wall, this kind of opportunity is just out of reach today, and 2023 it will probably start to become a reality.

\_\_\_

**Have you been worried about being replaced by automation, and can't for the life of you think of something better to focus you energy on to future proof your livelihood?** Of course keep thinking about that, keep studying or working or whatever you do to keep yourself financially and mentally stable. But **I urge you to get as familiar as possible with using AI right now**. Use it in your spare time, use it for everything you can even when you don't need to. It may seem easy to get the results you want, but try getting the exact results you want. Try getting the wrong results. Try getting results you never thought of. Try pretending it's 5 years in the future and life is just ""this way"" now and you use your ""AI assistant"" for everything.

Don't wind up being your grandparents that only use the internet for ""The Facebook,"" you are already interested in this stuff being a part of this Subreddit, keep pushing to follow the news. If someone posts an AI paper and it makes no sense to you, research it. Figure out what it could mean for the future of AI. Stay vigilant, because a month of missed information could be *everything*.

None of us will be able to stay up to date with every single bit of news, information is already coming in too fast to read it all but it will keep accelerating. Familiarizing yourself with the technology now will be immensely easier than starting from scratch later, and it'll keep you ahead of the curve for as long as possible.

**We can only speculate how long or even if AGI comes** sooner or later or even at all. But what we do know now, is **Transformative AI is here** on our doorstep, and we need to prepare ourselves. The advantage to knowing what's coming isn't to gloat and have the opportunity to say ""I told you so"" to the people in our lives that were oblivious and caught off guard. The *real advantage* is right in front of our faces: It's to use it and practice with it, to be *inspired* now by it so we can hit the ground running.

\_\_\_

**TLDR:** If you're unsure what the future holds with employment and automation, you're probably a little anxious trying to come up with what you can do to prevent being obsolete. While I'm not a prophet and I have no idea what the future for myself or anyone else holds, I can say without a doubt: **Learn how to use AI. RIGHT NOW!** It will be important, you will be thankful you did. You might think you already have, and it's not that difficult. **You're wrong**, there's things it can do today that will still surprise you. In 2 weeks, or a month, or 2 months it will continue to surprise you. Soon the limits to its capabilities will only be your own imagination. Even if it just means you become a more productive and learned individual, you at least won't be left behind and angry in the dust. *Stay on the progressive side of tech, it isn't going to stop before it comes for* ***your*** *job.*",284,167,1670878476,
Cold Email Masterclass from someone sending 1 to 1.5 million emails per month,"Nick Abraham sends 1 to 1.5 million cold emails per month for over 150 active clients for his agency, LeadBird.

The best clients include a yoga instructor who sells classes to local businesses. Her campaign absolutely prints. Another client sells wooden pallets to manufacturing companies, which also prints.

Nick recently went on the In The Pit Podcast and gave a Cold Email Masterclass. I've compiled a summary below.

## 1. Effective Offers

The most crucial factor for cold email success is having a solid offer that solves market pain points.

For example, a video production agency can't just pitch **""nice videos"".**

They need to focus on the impact, like getting more leads or customers through 1-minute VSL videos.

To increase response rates, add a guarantee to your offer that minimizes the prospect's risk.

He recommends having a dynamic pitch on sales calls. So if a client doesn't meet the criteria for the guarantee, you can adjust the pitch.

> ""Even if you offer a guarantee in your initial pitch, you don't have to stick to it rigidly on every sales call. Sales is dynamic. If you get on a call and realize the customer doesn't meet the criteria for your guarantee, you can adjust your approach. You might say something like:

'Typically, we do guarantee results for clients. However, I've noticed that your situation is a bit different because of X, Y, and Z. While I can't offer the same guarantee in your case, I still believe our solution would work well for you. Here's what I think the results could be. Would you be interested in giving it a try?'

This way, you're being honest and flexible, and you can still potentially close the deal without compromising your integrity or over-promising."" ~ Paraphrasing Nick Abraham

## 2. Personalization

Nick says personalization and finding intent signals can boost cold email performance.

Examples of intent signals:

1. **Scraping followers engaging with relevant content on LinkedIn** - Let's say I have a tool similar to Swell AI, and I'm a competitor. I could input Swell AI's LinkedIn profile into our internal tool. The tool would then scrape everyone who has engaged (liked and commented) with the last 30 posts. This shows intent from people who could potentially use a podcasting tool.
2. **Scraping followers of competitor companies on LinkedIn** - Another strategy I like to use for finding intent is scraping the followers of a company on LinkedIn. For instance, if your biggest competitor has 60,000 followers on their LinkedIn page, we'd scrape all of those followers' information. Then we'd email each of them with our value proposition. We might say, ""They don't offer performance-based services, but we do."" as a differentiation. We generated 450+ leads in under 3 months using this and it was one of the best-performing campaigns last year.
3. **Identifying companies hiring for relevant roles (e.g. SDRs) via job postings** - Another approach is to look for intent in job postings. For example, if a company with about 150 employees is hiring an SDR or BDR, they probably don't have a large sales team yet. They likely just need someone to generate leads - which is exactly what we do.

## 3. Cold Email Strategies

### A. High-Volume Emailing Tactics

Nick suggests using educational panels (greyhat) to create multiple inboxes without monthly costs. You could go load up a 1000 domains into these panels to create 10,000 inboxes in there and have no monthly cost.

Educational panels are sold by Google and Microsoft to organizations, often schools in foreign countries.

The cons of this approach are that the entire panel could get shut down, forcing you to start over. Your IP might be based in a foreign country, which could affect deliverability.

Benefits of using educational panels:

- No monthly costs for inboxes
- Ability to create many inboxes quickly
- Can lower volume per inbox while maintaining high overall volume

This approach is particularly useful if you're trying to send high volumes (like 100,000 emails a month) while keeping costs down and maintaining good deliverability.

### B. Automation for Efficiency

Nick recommends to automate the process of buying domains, setting up DNS, and creating email accounts.

For example, LeadBird has an internal tool that automatically handles these tasks, allowing them to focus on campaign performance.

### C. Focus on Contact-to-Lead Ratio

Nick says you to optimize campaigns by focusing on the contact-to-lead ratio rather than open or reply rates.

They constantly test and refine offers, angles, and CTAs to improve this metric.

## 4. Cold Email Infrastructure

Nick's agency uses a mix of tools and in-house software:

1. **Inbox providers:** Mainly Microsoft and Google, moving away from just Outlook
2. **Domains:** Bought on Porkbun, DNS on Cloudflare
3. **Sending Emails:** Smartlead with same-provider inbox matching
4. **Validation:** MillionVerifier for cost-effectiveness, internal Scrubby tool for catchalls
5. **CRM:** HubSpot internally but recommends Streak for others

If reply rates drop below 1%, consider the domain ""cooked"" and move on to spin up new inboxes/domains. This approach is more effective than trying to repair reputation, as the end goal is to maximize overall volume rather than individual inbox health.

## 5. Bonus Examples

### 1. Automatic Account Creation For Users

Nick has a SaaS lead generation campaign for which the following example works really well for conversion:

They have their developer automatically create accounts for potential users on their end. Then they email them and basically tell them about the product.

They say something like, **""Hey, we created an account for you. Here's your username and password. Let us know what you think. Feel free to sign in and check it out.""**

And it absolutely converts.

### 2. YouTube Clips Offer

Swell AI is doing a similar version of this, with just the offer being a bit different.

They say something like, **""Hey, reply with a YouTube URL, and we'll make clips for you for free.""**

When a prospect replies with a YouTube URL, they create an account for them in their system. They create clips from the provided YouTube video. Then, they drop the created content into the newly created account.

They send an email back to the prospect, essentially inviting them from within the app. The email includes a message like: **""We've set this up for you. Here's your login link.""**

By creating the account and content upfront, they increase the likelihood of the prospect logging in and engaging with the product.

There's no credit card required at this stage, reducing friction for initial engagement. The goal is to get prospects to log in and see the value of the service firsthand.

They only charge the prospect when they actually want to use the service beyond the initial free clips.

This offer accounted for 20% of their new revenue this month.

We bootstrapped our AI SaaS to multi-million ARR and 10M+ users in 3 years. Here's how we did it. AMA!,"Hey r/saas! I'm Sam, founder and CEO of [Writesonic](https://writesonic.com), and I'm here to share our rollercoaster ride from a college side project to a suite of AI tools used by millions. It's been a wild journey, full of pivots, challenges, and unexpected successes. Grab a coffee (or your beverage of choice), because this is going to be a long one!

# Quick Stats to Blow Your Mind:

* ?? Multi-million dollar ARR
* ?懃 Over 10 million registered users
* ?搱 At Chatsonic's peak: 3M+ monthly active users
* ?挵 Raised $2.6M, but haven't touched it (profitable from day one!)
* ?憋笍 All of this in just about 3 years

Now, let's dive into how we got here...

# The Seeds of AI: College Days and TLDR

My journey into the world of AI and SaaS started long before Writesonic was even a concept. Back in college, I was that guy who always had a new side project cooking. Every day brought a new idea, a new challenge to tackle. It was exhilarating, but little did I know it was also preparing me for the entrepreneurial journey ahead.

In 2019, fresh out of college, I built my first AI SaaS application: [tldrthis.com](https://tldrthis.com). The idea was born out of a personal frustration - there was just too much information on the internet to consume. Articles, blogs, research papers - the sheer volume was overwhelming. That's when it hit me: why not create a tool that uses AI to summarize all that content? The concept was simple but powerful: TLDR would give you the gist of any long-form content, helping you decide if it's worth your precious time to read the whole thing.

Developing TLDR was a crash course in AI application development. I had to grapple with natural language processing, figure out how to handle various document formats, and create an intuitive user interface. It was challenging, but incredibly rewarding. To my surprise and delight, TLDR gained traction. It started making revenue, and the best part? It's still alive and kicking today, generating income on autopilot. We haven't updated it in years, yet it continues to provide value to users. This success, modest as it was, gave me the confidence to dream bigger.

# The GPT-3 Goldmine: Early Access and Experiments

Fast forward to mid-2020. OpenAI had just announced GPT-3, and the tech world was buzzing with excitement. Taking a shot in the dark, I emailed Greg Brockman, then CTO of OpenAI. To my amazement, not only did he respond, but I landed in the first 100 beta users to get access to GPT-3. It felt like striking gold in the AI rush.

With this powerful new tool at my disposal, I started experimenting immediately. My first project was a Chrome extension called ""Magic Email."" The idea was to use GPT-3 to revolutionize emails right within Gmail. It could help create new emails from scratch, summarize long email threads, and even suggest responses. Developing Magic Email was an exciting process, but we hit some significant roadblocks with Google Workspace approvals and struggled to find that elusive product-market fit.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson early on: cool technology alone isn't enough. You need to solve a real, pressing problem that users are willing to pay for. It was a tough pill to swallow, but it shaped my approach to product development moving forward.

# The Birth of Writesonic: AI-Powered Landing Pages

The failure of Magic Email led to a period of reflection. I had all these side projects, each with potential, but I was struggling with a common problem: marketing. Specifically, I couldn't create compelling landing pages to save my life. That's when inspiration struck. I had this incredibly powerful language model at my fingertips with GPT-3. Why not use it to create landing pages?

The process of building this initial version of Writesonic was fascinating. I spent weeks training GPT-3 on the best landing pages I could find. When we first launched [Writesonic](https://writesonic.com), it was a simple pay-as-you-go model. For $5 or $10, you could generate a landing page. The response was encouraging, but we quickly realized that the pricing model wasn't quite right.

This feedback led to our first major pivot. We went back to the drawing board and completely revamped the product. Instead of just landing pages, we expanded to cover all sorts of AI copywriting - social media posts, blog articles, product descriptions, advertisements, you name it. We also switched to a subscription model, providing more value and predictability for our users.

This revamp was a game-changer. Within a couple of months, we hit our first $10k in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). It was a modest sum in the grand scheme of things, but for us, it was validation. We weren't just building cool tech; we were solving a real problem that people were willing to pay for.

# Y Combinator and Funding: A Last-Minute Decision

March 2021 rolls around, and everyone on Twitter is buzzing about Y Combinator applications. With literally one day left before the deadline, I thought, ""Why not?"" and decided to apply. Here's the kicker: I used GPT-3 to answer most of the application questions. Talk about eating your own dog food!

To my shock and delight, we got an interview and then acceptance into the Summer 2021 batch. This acceptance brought with it a major life decision. At the time, I was working as a tech consultant at Deloitte in London. Getting into YC meant quitting my job, moving back to India, and going all-in on Writesonic. It was a big leap, but in my gut, I knew it was the right move.

The YC experience was transformative. We were surrounded by brilliant founders, had access to incredible mentors, and were pushed to grow faster than we ever thought possible. Post-YC, we raised a $2.6 million seed round. But here's the plot twist: We've been profitable since day one and haven't touched that money. In fact, we've got more in the bank now than we raised. This puts us in a unique position - we have the resources of a funded startup but the discipline and efficiency of a bootstrapped company.

# Riding the AI Wave: Photosonic, Chatsonic, and Beyond

The AI world moves fast, and we've had to move faster. When Stable Diffusion and DALL路E 3 made waves in image generation around July or August 2022, we quickly developed and launched Photosonic, a dedicated AI image generation tool. It was an instant hit, but we eventually decided to fold it back into Writesonic as a feature, teaching us an important lesson about focusing on our core strengths.

The real game-changer in our journey was ChatGPT. When OpenAI launched it in November 2022, we saw both a threat and an opportunity. Instead of panicking, we acted fast. Just 10 days after ChatGPT's launch, we introduced [Chatsonic](https://writesonic.com/chat).

Chatsonic was designed to address several limitations we identified in ChatGPT:

1. Real-time information: Unlike ChatGPT's knowledge cutoff in 2021, Chatsonic could access current information.
2. Multimodal capabilities: Chatsonic could not only process text but also generate and analyze images and audio.
3. File processing: We enabled Chatsonic to read and analyze uploaded files, expanding its utility for businesses.
4. Personalization: Users could customize Chatsonic's personality and tone to fit their needs.

The launch of Chatsonic was a pivotal moment for us. We got 3,000 upvotes on Product Hunt, a retweet from Greg Brockman, and an enormous influx of users. At its peak, Chatsonic was serving over 3 million users per month, helping catapult our total registered user base to over 10 million across all our products.

  
**Our growth strategy for Chatsonic was multifaceted:**

1. Influencer Partnerships: We collaborated with AI tool influencers on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok. These partnerships gave us credibility and exposed Chatsonic to a wider audience.
2. SEO: We aggressively targeted the keyword ""ChatGPT alternatives"" through both organic content and paid ads. Our blog post on this topic ranked in the top 2-3 results for months, driving millions in revenue.
3. Content Marketing: We created in-depth comparisons, use-case articles, and tutorials to showcase Chatsonic's unique features.
4. PR: We reached out to tech publications, gave interviews, and even appeared on TV shows. This media exposure significantly boosted our visibility.
5. Product-Led Growth: We focused on creating a superior user experience, encouraging organic word-of-mouth growth.
6. Freemium Model: We offered a generous free tier, allowing users to experience Chatsonic's power before committing to a paid plan.

These efforts paid off tremendously. Chatsonic helped us multiply our revenue significantly in just 3-4 months, pushing us into multi-million dollar ARR territory.

# Botsonic: Customized AI for Every Business

Building on the success of Chatsonic, we launched [Botsonic](https://botsonic.com) to cater to businesses seeking customized AI solutions. Botsonic allows companies to create ChatGPT-like chatbots trained on their specific data and knowledge base.

Key features of Botsonic include:

1. Create and deploy custom AI chatbots without writing any code

"With Trump taking power, a war on White Collar workers has begun for the 1st time in US history.","To understand the future, you must realize Blue Collar has already suffered for decades. Expect a long brutal decline. There is no savior coming... Blue Collar workers already know this well. 

A perfect storm scenario has emerged that will destroy the White Collar class as we know it today.  

AI is here and will begin to take jobs shortly. With no end in sight. 

Government layoffs have begun across all branches. 

Tax cuts are coming that favor Blue Collar workers. Be it firemen, police, or tip earners. 

Efforts are being made to bring Blue Collar manufacturing jobs back to the US. 

Work from home is being attacked and ridiculed at every opportunity.

The middle class will obviously shrink but it's not so much an attack on the middle class as it is specifically on White Collar. I don't have answers or solutions, for decades the Blue Collar workers didn't either....

I fear especially if AI progresses as rapidly as the stock market seems to expect, this attack on White Collar work will all but wipe them out. 

Take a look at how many talks got cut from Twitter for example... By Elon Musk. 

Finally I think the economy will obviously take a major dive and eventually most of the replaced/eliminated White Collar workers will be shuffled off to lower class citizen status on some sort of subsistence level UBI.
 
**AI version below. 

Here?檚 a refined and expanded version of your text, with improved structure, clarity, and depth while maintaining the original tone and message:**

---

With the resurgence of Trump?檚 political influence, a new and unprecedented chapter in American economic history has begun: a systematic war on White Collar workers. For the first time, the focus of economic disruption and policy shifts is squarely targeting the professional class, a group that has long been insulated from the kind of upheaval Blue Collar workers have endured for decades. To grasp the gravity of what lies ahead, it?檚 essential to recognize that the decline of Blue Collar work was merely the prelude. What?檚 coming for White Collar workers will be a prolonged, brutal transformation?攐ne that will reshape the American workforce and society as we know it.

A perfect storm of factors is converging, creating a scenario that will dismantle the White Collar class in its current form. At the forefront is the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is no longer a distant threat; it?檚 here, and it?檚 poised to automate vast swaths of White Collar jobs?攆rom data analysis and customer service to legal research and even creative fields. Unlike previous technological shifts, this wave of automation shows no signs of slowing down. The jobs it replaces may never return.

Simultaneously, government layoffs are sweeping across all branches, further eroding the stability of White Collar employment. These cuts are not isolated incidents but part of a broader trend that prioritizes austerity and efficiency over the preservation of traditional professional roles. Meanwhile, tax policies are being reshaped to favor Blue Collar workers?攆irefighters, police officers, service industry employees, and others in hands-on or tip-based professions. This shift in fiscal priorities signals a deliberate rebalancing of economic incentives, one that sidelines White Collar workers in favor of their Blue Collar counterparts.

Efforts to revive Blue Collar manufacturing jobs are also gaining momentum, with policies aimed at bringing production back to the United States. While this may benefit certain segments of the workforce, it does little to address the looming crisis for White Collar professionals. Compounding the issue is the growing backlash against remote work. Once hailed as a revolutionary shift in workplace flexibility, work-from-home arrangements are now being attacked and ridiculed at every turn, further destabilizing the White Collar workforce.

The consequences of these changes are stark. The middle class, already under immense pressure, will shrink dramatically. But this isn?檛 merely a broad attack on the middle class?攊t?檚 a targeted assault on White Collar workers specifically. For decades, Blue Collar workers bore the brunt of economic dislocation, often without clear solutions or pathways forward. Now, White Collar workers face a similar fate, with few answers or strategies to navigate the coming upheaval.

The rapid pace of AI development exacerbates these fears. If the stock market?檚 bullish expectations for AI are any indication, the technology?檚 impact on White Collar jobs could be catastrophic. Already, we?檙e seeing signs of this shift in action. Take, for example, Elon Musk?檚 drastic cuts at Twitter (now X), where entire teams and functions were eliminated overnight. This is not an isolated incident but a harbinger of what?檚 to come across industries.

Ultimately, the economic fallout from these trends will be severe. As White Collar jobs disappear, many displaced workers will face a precipitous decline in status and income. The likely outcome is a mass demotion to lower-class citizenship, sustained only by some form of subsistence-level Universal Basic Income (UBI). While UBI may provide a safety net, it will hardly compensate for the loss of meaningful work, financial security, and social standing that once defined the White Collar class.

In this new era, the lines between Blue Collar and White Collar work will blur, but the pain of this transition will be felt most acutely by those who once believed their education, skills, and professional roles would shield them from economic disruption. The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: the White Collar class is facing an existential crisis, and the road ahead will be fraught with challenges.

/u/LiterallyKaiser on The future of the Job Market and Automation,"There's a few problems I don't see discussed often in relation to this topic:

  - Most new jobs created by automation will likely require an advanced degree, probably in a STEM field. That is not a pathway many people are capable of, academically/intellectually and financially. What are you going to do with the 40-70% of people not able to get into these degree paths that have any sort of payoff?
  - Almost all job growth in the immediate future due to automation will likely be limited to a few locales, chiefly big, coastal cities with extensive wifi, 5G access, etc. Smaller cities like Lima will be once again left out, as will rural America. What are they to do?
  - The very real possibility wages don't actually increase, but rather that companies just use automation to replace workers entirely, leaving millions left fetching for part time or underemployment prospects, destroying long term means of financial stability for the middle class (especially in regards to housing. Most middle class people have their wealth tied up in their homes; what happens when you're too poor to get a housing loan because the only jobs available are either tech moguls or nannies for said moguls?)
  - The fact that many current IT and even STEM jobs become replaced by AI in the future, not just blue collar or service industries.
  - Does this open up our economy to risks of cyberattack from China/Russia/other adversaries?

Seems like something we should think about from a societal stability standpoint and not just some blind capitalist/free market dogmatism. You can't have a stable nation with a tiny, ultra wealthy elite ruling over impoverished masses with little hope of upwards mobility.

I am scared for the future of the tech industry - our industry is at a major crossroads right now ,"I've been working in QA for two years. I make 60k and can barely save money in this market. Housing is so expensive. I live in New England and pay $1250 a month for a decent-sized Studio Apartment. But after taxes, insurance, 7% 401k match, and 100 dollars into a Sofi Emergency fund, I'm left with a $1686.92 check to live off of. I drive a 2010 Camry and drive 45 minutes to the office. I am only allowed to work from home once a week unless I am sick.  Alot of people who are living in poverty or stuck with parents are jealous, but it isn't comfortable by any means. I just paid electricity, put half of rent for the month into my rent checking account, just paid money for toll, paid off a little debt, 20 dollars for some cold meds, and $60 for some edibles, I am left with $333 in my regular checking account and $95 dollars in cash for the next two weeks. And some of that has to go to gas and food.

I would love a better job, but even my local market, I can't find a job. Even if I get two interviews, someone else is just better for the job. I have mobile automation experience and know Android, Kotlin, React, NodeJS, MySQL, and even a little python all on top of all of my manual testing experience.

I am so worried for America's future. 20 years ago, 60k would get you a house and be able to raise a family. Now it's barely enough to live in New England by yourself. I'm afraid AI is going to completely overhaul our industry to the point Software Engineering is never going to be the sexy job it was 5-10 years ago again. It was one of the last industries where you could live the American dream; Go to college, get a job, buy a house, and raise kids.  If the tech industry truly goes downhill long term, America is in HUGE trouble economically, especially in big cities.",75,73,1725585507,
How Not To Get Replaced By AI,"I'll try to keep this short and expand in the comments. I run a meetup in Seattle helping people prepare for the upcoming disruption in the job market due to AI. The basic thesis is the cliche ""you won't get replaced by AI but by someone who knows how to use AI"". That goes out the window with AGI/ASI but for the next couple years, that is somewhat valid.

There are many professions that are AI safe forever - human made art will always be in demand. Sports professionals will be in demand, even when robots are better ballers. In the near term - 15 years and less, professions like plumbing and electricians, doctors, nurses, are safe. Please list any other safe professions.

In the short term, many professions are at risk. If you're a software developer, well my personal experience has been that I can do the work of 3-5 junior developers using AI tools. In fact I built an app in a couple hours that would have taken me 1-2 years before (part time work 2 years). OpenAI is claiming they have a model that is scoring 50th in the world on a benchmark, and may reach #1 by the end of the year. So coding algorithms is going to be replaced soon. But taking fuzzy requirements and turning them into a design, that is further out. And not all AI generated code will necessarily work without some assistance. Simple apps are easy to generate but once it gets more complicated AI can't do the entire job. A senior dev is required to get everything to work.

My personal prediction is in 5 years, for development of software, including AI development, a single senior/principal engineer managing AI can do the work of between 10-100 seniors without AI. 

So basically, there are two paths to being able to generate revenue in the next couple years (less than 15 years when my predictions are all off, who knows what will happen). You either do something that is always going to be needed to be done by humans like human created art or sports, or you learn to use AI to be more powerful and do more.

Corporations will need far less people and there will be massive layoffs and unemployment. For a certain period of time though, a couple people (or even just one person) can use AI tools to run an entire company and create value. When you own your own company, you are not at risk of getting laid off. However, depending on the business, others may be able to saturate the market and do the same thing. So if you can combine real world value like a bake shop, you're better off, than just building a SaaS that is 100% automated. 

This is just a little bit of information we've gathered, agreed on, I wanted to share. Generating value and income is a good thing, for the time being, until all bets are off and 99% of jobs are automated. 

So what are you doing to get prepared for getting replaced by AI? And maybe you're not affected by AI job replacement yet, maybe you don't have experience yet, and need to get it, or you've been laid off by a corporation and looking for work. Are you using AI to be more productive? To increase your marketability?

I'm curious what is the pain you've experienced in staying up to date with AI and being as powerful as you can be using these exponentially increasing capabilities. Do you use e-learning? apps? How are you keeping your skills up to date? How are you building companies? What are you doing? If you're not doing anything yet but just spectating, when do you plan to make a change and get going before its too late? AI is making the impossible possible. What are you doing to be an active participant and not just a bystander?

In summary, my thesis is that as we accelerate, corporations will shrink in size, unemployment will increase, but there will be a large number of small corporations that will be created, creating an enormous amount of value and innovation. Perhaps you'll be one of those business owners solving hard problems that were impossible before. Let's hear from you!",6,45,1739832350,
Advice for Aspiring Software Developers: Don't,"**Why You Should Listen to Me:**

I?檓 a principal engineer, which means I hire a lot of developers. I also hire developers for my personal projects.

Why This Is a Bad Time to Launch Your Career as a Software Developer:
If you?檙e a rockstar developer (and you know if you are), none of this applies to you?攁nd you?檙e too busy to read it anyway. Everyone else, pay attention.

Hiring patterns change on the margin: If you have a rare skill or unique talent, you?檒l get hired. But junior devs are competing with the masses, and they?檙e getting hit hardest by recent changes.

**1. Bad Economy**

In today?檚 high-interest-rate environment, companies are tightening their budgets, slowing down hiring, and focusing on cost-effectiveness. Here?檚 how it impacts software developers:

Preference for Senior Devs: Companies are prioritizing experienced hires who can deliver results immediately with minimal oversight. A single senior developer (costing $120K??200K per year in the U.S.) is often seen as a better investment than hiring multiple juniors who require significant training, mentorship, and ramp-up time. From a business perspective, one senior dev can often replace the productivity of three or more juniors, making them a more cost-effective and reliable choice in a tight economy.

Increased Outsourcing: When additional manpower is needed, companies are opting for cheaper offshore options. Indian developers, for instance, charge $15??30/hour on platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, compared to U.S. juniors who often expect $50/hour or more.

**2. Global Market Post-COVID**

COVID-19 accelerated remote work and broadened the hiring pool. Companies are no longer limited to local talent and can access highly skilled developers abroad:

For personal projects, I?檝e hired developers from Pakistan and Ukraine who charge around $20/hour. They?檝e delivered excellent results for a fraction of the U.S. cost.

The number of international freelance developers on platforms like Upwork increased by +30% since 2020, creating intense competition for entry-level roles.

Developers in countries with lower costs of living can afford to undercut U.S. rates significantly while maintaining strong work quality.

**3. AI Is Replacing Junior Developers**

AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT-4 have dramatically increased developer productivity:

Studies show that developers using AI can produce code 2??0x faster, reducing the need for larger teams.

In many cases, engineering managers (myself included) and product owners are using AI to write code directly. It?檚 often faster than coordinating with a team?攁nd eliminates the need to hire more people.

Junior-level work like boilerplate coding, debugging, or basic scripting is increasingly automated, shrinking the demand for entry-level roles.

**Conclusion:**

It?檚 not a great time to jumpstart a software developer career. Competition is high, opportunities for juniors are shrinking, and AI is eroding entry-level job availability.

(That said, if you have serious passion and raw talent, go for it anyway.)

**Why You Should Still Learn to Code:**

While it may not be the best time to launch a career, it?檚 an excellent time to learn to code. Here?檚 why:

LLM Tools Empower Non-Techies: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT make it easier than ever to launch apps and automate daily workflows.

Basic Coding Knowledge Is Key: To use these tools effectively, you still need a solid grasp of programming basics and syntax. Think of it as a power multiplier?攜our potential grows exponentially with even moderate coding proficiency.",58,43,1736897439,
Biglaw to Solo - Six Months In,"I suggest you read [my first post, at the three-month mark](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/s/Zbh3X8mkjX), before reading this one, but if not I'll give a brief tldr anyway: 

*On the last episode of Biglaw to Solo...*

At the time of my last post, about three months ago, I was solo, with a virtual assistant, building a personal injury/disability claims firm, working part-time for an injury/disability form and an estate planning firm to pay the bills while I get off the ground. I also noted I have three kids, and a wife who works very part time.聽

OK, buckle up, because a LOT has changed, and this is long.聽



**I Can't Work Unless You Give Me Work**

In November, the disability attorney I worked for on a weekly retainer ?渞ealized??I wasn't billing the 15 hours/week we had used to calculate my pay. This despite me telling him, repeatedly, that I wasn't billing 15 hours a week, that I needed more work, that I couldn't start assignments until he gave me the files I needed for those assignments, etc. He's near retirement, and has been a true solo for the past 8 years, so he is not used to delegating, and he was not good at it. He did the math and realized I was about 50 hours behind a 15hr/wk pace, and when a major case fell off, he said he didn't have money to pay me. So he didn't. My wife's main job also fell apart the same week - a week before Christmas, which was really delightful timing to lose more than half my income, and hers.聽



**Hey Biglaw Payroll Dept., I Miss You**

In the first week of January, I realized my other contracting聽 job (trusts and estates) had not paid me the previous week's paycheck. When I asked about it, they profusely apologized, and said they'd pay me the next day. But something didn't look right about the pay period they indicated. So I went into Gusto and started looking at pay stubs and聽 time clock records. I discovered that they owed me over $4000 of back pay - about five weeks. They had missed weeks, paid partial weeks, and even double-paid one week. It was a mess. I sent them a spreadsheet and explanation, they took accountability, and over the next four weeks they caught up my pay, though one of those promised payments ALSO came another week late. Ironically, the whole snafu was something of a stroke of fortune, as those additional paychecks those weeks made up for the other job.聽



**New Cases**

A few more contingency cases kept coming in, though they don't pay out yet, of course. A couple came through the bar association referral program, several came through attorney referrals (cases too small for my colleagues), and a few just organically found my website, which is fairly barebones, and has no intentional SEO. Perks of a niche practice, I guess. I had a law firm marketer from my undergrad contact me and offer a month of free paid Google Ads. He charged no fee, and even paid the Google fees as well. Unfortunately, I kept getting false hits; people who didn't have the right kind of claim for my practice. He was a good guy, but without proof of concept I couldn't justify continuing beyond the free trial.聽



**Back to Solo**

My VA, who was great, let me know in November that she had gotten an offer to work full time for another firm, and she had to take it. She said she would stay with me if I could give her at least 30 hours, but I just couldn't. I couldn't even guarantee her 15 at that time. She understood. I was happy for her, and we left on good terms.聽



**Major Realization 1: Lawyer vs. CEO**

I have come to realize that I like the business side of running a law firm better than the substantive legal side. Building the systems, designing a marketing strategy, working with technology, and managing/mentoring an employee were what got me jumping out of bed in the morning, and had me working excitedly into the evening. The legal work was nerve wracking, stressful, and yet often dull. While that could change or be mitigated with experience, I felt convinced I will always look at development of the business as my primary interest, which makes sense with my discontentment with Biglaw, even though it was the best possible Biglaw situation (see previous post), and my desire to start my own firm. So, I started thinking about ways to maximize my focus on business development, which leads to?β?


**Major Realization 2: All in the Game**

All the while, I've been working 10-20 hours/week doing estate planning for the other firm. They're a five-attorney general practice firm based in the next state over, and I have been their key into my city's market. Despite the payroll failures, I really like the firm. They've been aggressively trying to get me to join them full time, to do estate planning or any other practice I want. I've been honest with them, saying I like running my own firm too much, but we would see how it goes.聽



Estate planning isn't the most substantive thrilling practice, but it has its own kind of logical elegance, and above all, it has some incredible advantages as a practice from a business perspective. It is systematizable, as the client experience is largely similar from one to the next. It lends itself well to flat fee and prepayment. It's easily marketable, as everyone is a potential client; you don't have to wait for them to get in an accident, get disabled, or have a dispute. Case timelines are somewhat short but recur years later, and happy clients tend to refer you easily. In a referral networking meeting I go to, I found myself focusing on estate planning because of these advantages, to the neglect of my own practice areas.聽



So, while I get 10 percent commission on work generated for the firm I contract for, I realized that I would much prefer 100 percent commission. So, over the last few weeks I have pivoted entirely to estate planning. I felt somewhat bad about turning into a competitor for the firm that taught me estate planning, as I really like them and they've largely done right by me. But I talked to them just the other day about it, before publicly pivoting my practice in earnest, and they could not be more supportive. I can keep working for them hourly as much as I want, they'll refer clients to me that are outside their convenient reach, I'll send them clients with taxable or complex estates, and they even said I could use their templates, though I'm not going to.聽



**EP Clients**

Clients are pouring in, at about $3-4.5k each. My referral marketing group has generated two clients, with two more close. I have made connections with four financial advisors, one of whom has a whole day booked for me at her office later this month, where I will do intake with five new clients. I sat at my wife's gym for three hours today with a table and some flyers and booked five consults and made 10 more contacts. My close rate for consults is over 80 percent, and with the value per client so high, even closing one client makes just about any expenditure of time or money profitable. I am also in the network of a legal insurance group, which gives me one or two new clients a week at $1k each.

I have been referring out most of my litigation clients who haven't yet filed a complaint so that I can focus on estate planning. Most without any expectation of a fee.聽



**Tech**

I am still on Zoho One, which I like, and I've really enjoyed building it out now that I have a more predictable lead funnel and client/case process. I love my new Microsoft Surface Laptop, which I bought on sale and using a special promotion through Best Buy, although I cracked the screen the other day and it'll be $700 to replace??sigh. For estate planning, I use WealthCounsel, which has excellent training resources and is the top drafting solution. It's great so far, if a bit expensive. The worst thing is I'm on the hook for Lexis for three years, and it will be pretty much useless for me soon. It's $89 a month until next January, then $300-something. I will attempt to cancel soon, but I hear there is little hope.聽



**Reflections and Goals**

It feels good to be where I am, after quite a ride. December-January were very worrisome. Making the mortgage was legitimately a concern, as we had a family issue that siphoned nearly all of our emergency cushion mere weeks prior. But now, I have my excitement back, I am getting my footing in the substantive law, and feeling confident in consultations with clients.聽



By the nine-month mark, I would like to be signing two new private-pay clients per week. My mother in law has started helping out on an ad-hoc basis, and I'd like to be giving her 15 hours per week by then. I want my systems to be firmly in place but constantly under refinement. I'd like to have automation and AI shouldering some of the administrative load.聽I would like my estate plan drafting to be clean and efficient, and to have great resources in place to search out answers to problems I can't solve on my own. By my one-year anniversary, I'd like to be taking home at least 75% of the salary I left in Biglaw (which was $235k), and I would like to have a full-time virtual assistant.



I still believe going solo was unquestionably the right decision for me. I still think lawyers are too cautious and risk-averse with their own careers, and anyone who has the itch to go solo should have confidence and develop a plan to move on that itch.聽



Thanks for reading! Happy to answer questions or clarify. I'll report again in three months.聽",62,36,1739127523,
What does the future of our work look like in the age of AI tools,"I'm sure we've all been thinking a lot lately about how AI is shaking things up in our field.

I was asked in my last job by management to evaluate the space of AI tools and see if we could be more efficient with our work, but I found most things to just be poorly tweaked API interfaces. I think the reason might be that the space is dominated by young developers today who lack the mileage needed in the marketing trenches to really know what the daily jobs require. 

-------------

I figure it's time to have some of that conversation, but limited to this thread. We're not an AI subreddit and we're not going to bury ourselves in the hype of the day.

I'm curious to hear how everyone sees where we are. Which tasks could be optimized or automated with a little help from AI? Where could we drop some of the daily labor into an automation tool and where can we use it to plan, structure, and go beyond the boring ops?

**I know we've had pretty strict policy about AI tools and a no-promotion policy since day one, and that's not changing.** That's why those discussions should concentrate in here and that's why I'm pinning the post. But we all exist in a world where AI is coming into our offices, and I think it's important we have a space to discuss what these changes mean for us.

This thread will be **heavily moderated** to stay on track as a discussion and not a graveyard of pitches, so please avoid any tool or service promotions, let's use this thread to talk about the bigger picture.

There might be a dedicated thread in the future where we can list actual solutions, but for now, let's focus on the needs of our work, ideas, and how it's all impacting what we do.",18,79,1728254558,

"Learnings from my Experience in USA: [BTech -> SWE [Msft India] -> MS -> MLE 2 [Tiktok, Meta]","**TLDR:**

1. US immigration and job landscape is not easily predictable, talk to as many people as you can. However, speak to folks who started their MS after 2021. There have been fundamental shifts in the last 3-4 years.
2. Competition is cut-throat at the ""Entry Level"" positions. It helps a lot to put some full-time experience on a resume.
3. Do not come without a plan, if you think I will go there and figure it out, it's too late.
4. Life in India is very binary and certain. Everyone gets a rank and based on that you get a degree/college. The USA is not like that. Everything here is probability. Folks with weaker profiles will get Admits/Jobs based on luck. Don't obsess over uncontrollable, build your profile. That's controllable.
5. Learn to deal with the probabilities of success and expected outcomes, this will help you manage uncertainty. You have to take risks and play to win.

**Goal**

The aim of this post is not to encourage or discourage you. It is to inform and equip you so that you can make the best decision for yourself. My views are highly opinionated.

Feel free to ask questions, and share your points or counterpoints.

**Background** (my\_qualifications)**:**

I graduated CSE BTech from a Tier 1 college in India in 2019. Joined Microsft in Hyderabad as a Front-End Engineer (No I did not want to do front-end, they just randomly allocated). Had a couple of NLP research papers and an 8.0 GPA. Microsoft paid well but I hated my job, I was looking for an out either by job change or MS.

Job change became a bit hard during early 2020 (COVID-19) and I got my admission so I picked MS.

**MS Applications:**

While applying extensively use tools like: [https://admits.com/](https://admits.com/) In my personal and peer experience the aggregated statistical data is a strong predictor of admits.

MS admits are mostly CGPA-based unless you have some stellar Research or LORs. So if the above data suggests that 50% of admitted folks have a lower CGPA than you, you will most likely get an admission.

My strategy was 2:2:4

2 safe where 60-70% of folks with lower GPA than me got Admit, 2 where 40-50% of folks with lower GPA than me got admit, 4 ambitious. I got both safe and 1 moderate and 0 ambitious

There has been huge CGPA inflation in recent years so when doing the math only count the last 2-3 years

**Talking Courses**

1. College and master's GPA matters very little unless you are in the Top 10 for the job hunt. It matters in research opportunities.
2. Public Colleges are cheaper and waive semester fees if you do TA or RA.
3. Projects matter on resumes, not grades. Take easier courses and courses with projects. Do not waste time taking courses with low demonstrable output or tough exams. Unless ofc you are passionate about a subject then go for it. Use [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) to research courses and profs.
4. Target profs you want to do research with, take their course in Sem 1 and ask questions, get an A. Then ask for opportunities. Research helps in non-generalist SWE roles.
5. Graduate early if possible, saves you a lot of money. (You start earning faster)

**How to do Job Applications:**

* Resume: [https://latexresu.me/](https://latexresu.me/) \[Suggested template, easy-to-use website\]
   * For my SWE friends: Do not make a resume with 5 simple Web Dev projects. It will kill you. Add complex projects that involve a diverse set of technologies beyond React. Like Distributed Systems, Data Pipelines, Caching, NoSQL DB, AWS, GCP, etc. I am no longer a SWE so not up to date, but you get the trend. Add a variety of complex projects that speak to your skills. Keep the language simple and easy to understand.
   * Keep it 1 page, put the graduation date on top, and do not put聽a ""Summary"" section.
   * Add a skills section and cast a wide net. You want to hit all the terms the automated processor is looking for. Do not put niche technology that HR or AI might not be looking for or understand.
   * **HR is DUMB,** HR will evaluate your resume. Make your resume Dummy readable, don't try to be too smart. One time an HR I was talking to saw Transformers on my resume and said your profile is good and you know Transformers but we also need Neural Networks experience.
* Intern:
   * It's a very tough market, there has been exponential growth in US Bachelor and foreign MS CS (and allied fields).
   * You need to apply to 100s of positions to get an internship. So put your ego aside and apply like you brush your teeth. Do not expect rewards.
   * Apply quickly and apply with a referral (if possible). HR get 10x more resumes than they need. **Applying early and/or with refferral is the only way to make sure your resume is even considered by a human.**
   * Use this tool: [https://simplify.jobs/](https://simplify.jobs/) to apply faster.
   * **I had applied to over 1000 jobs got 40-50 Online assessments, and cleared all but 2/3. This led to less than 10 actual interviews.**
   * Apply to every company and every relevant role (SWE, MLE, DS, DE, etc), **don't be picky.** Create separate versions of resumes for each of these roles.
* Full Time:
   * All points in the intern hunt still apply here.
   * Try to build some specialization, don't be a generic SWE, which has the most competition. You have a ""Masters"" degree now its time to know more than the basic skills.
   * Search for ""hiring SWE"" and filter by last 24 hours, you will find many managers' posts. Reply and reach out to them (if you feel rich, buy LinkedIn Premium). Do this twice daily, so you reach out to the poster within 12 hours. **Speed is critical.**

**Visa and Immigration:**

* US govt has taken steps to make the H1B less scam-free. These steps help the F1 -> H1B pipeline over Consultancy. The worst of H1B is behind us in my opinion.
* Trump might increase wage requirements for H1B which will mean you need to make $150k plus in the Bay Area (less for others). This might remove the lottery and make it entirely wage-based.",128,40,1733099833,
"The 15 Best (Free to Use) AI Tools for Creating Websites, Presentations, Graphics, UIs, Photos, and more","While we wait for ChatGPT to roll out its own official image input+output tool, I wanted to put together a list of the best AI design tools I've seen so far. Obviously text-based tasks like writing and coding get the bulk of the attention, but I wanted to see how it?檚 being used in design and more visual tasks. From UI and full-on website design, to graphics and photo generation, there are a ton of interesting and free tools coming out that are worth trying and using as inspiration for your own projects.

These tools cover a bunch of different use cases and can hopefully help some of you, whether you?檙e a professional designer looking to automate parts of your work or just someone who wants to find ways to speed up the design work for your business/side projects.

All of them are free to try, but most have some kind of paid plan or limit on the number of free generations. Fair enough given it costs money to run the models, but I've tried to include notes on any that don't have permanent free plans. Let me know if you know of any tools I?檝e missed so I can add them to the list! I?檝e grouped them by categories, to make it easier to see what each tool is capable of, then given a bit more detail under each specific tool.

## AI Website, Graphic and UI Generators:

* [**Framer**](https://framer.com)**:** Describe the website you want, and Framer will create it for you. Edit and instantly publish your site from their platform. Ironically my favorite thing about Framer isn?檛 its AI tool. Its real advantage is its website editor which is the best I?檝e seen on any platform (and usable for free). It?檚 like Figma if Figma let you publish directly to the web.
* [**Microsoft Designer**](https://designer.microsoft.com/)**:** Generates designs based on user input for social media posts, logos, and business graphics. It?檚 free to use with a Microsoft account, and fairly impressive if not always consistent. If you pay a lot or spend a ton of time on design/social media content, Designer is definitely worth checking out.
* [**UIzard**](https://uizard.io/)**:** Transforms text and images into design mockups, wireframes, and full user interfaces. It?檚 an ambitious concept, but very cool. While Framer was better for generating websites from text prompts, UIZard offers something none of the others did: taking a sketch drawing and turning it into a UI and/or wireframing.

## Visualizations, Graphics and Illustrations:

* [**Taskade**](https://taskade.com/)**:** AI powered productivity tool to visualize your notes, projects, and tasks. Taskade lets you easily generate mind maps and other visualizations of your work, and makes use of AI in a bunch of cool ways. For example, you can generate a mind map to help you brainstorm and then ask it to expand on a certain point or even research it for you with the internet.
* [**Bing Image Creator**](https://www.bing.com/create)**:** Generate images from natural text descriptions, powered by DALL-E. Whether you?檙e looking for blog illustrations, images for your site?檚 pages or any other purpose, it?檚 worth trying.
* [**AutoDraw**](https://www.autodraw.com/)**:** Autodraw is a Google Project that lets you draw something freehand with your cursor, and AutoDraw uses AI to transform it into a refined image with icons and predrawn designs, all for free in your browser.

## AI Presentations and Slides:

* [**Plus AI for Google Slides**](https://www.plusdocs.com/)**:** AI generated slides and full-on presentations, all within Google Slides. I liked how Plus AI worked within Google Slides and made it easy to make changes to the presentation (as lets be real, no AI tool is going to generate *exactly* the content and formatting you need for a serious presentation).
* [**SlidesGo**](https://slidesgo.com/)**:** Generate slides with illustrations, images, and icons chosen by AI. SlidesGo also has their own editor to let you edit and refine the AI generated presentation.
* [**Tome**](https://tome.app/)**:** Tell Tome what you want to say to your audience, and it will create a presentation that effectively communicates it clearly and effectively. Tome actually goes beyond just presentations and has a few cool formats worth checking out that I could see being useful for salespeople and anyone who needs to pitch an idea or product at work or to clients.

## Product Photography:

These are all fairly similar so I?檝e kept the descriptions short, but it?檚 genuinely a pretty useful category if you run any kind of business or side hustle that needs product photos. These photos establish the professionalism of your store/brand, and all the ones I tried had genuinely impressive results that seemed much better than what I could do myself.

* [**Pebblely**](https://pebblely.com/)**:** AI image generator for product images in various styles and settings. 40 free images, paid after that.
* [**Booth.ai**](http://booth.ai/)**:** Generates professional-quality product photos using AI, focused on furniture, fashion, and packaged goods.
* [**Stylized.ai**](http://stylized.ai/)**:** Generates product photos integrated into ecommerce platforms like Shopify.

## Miscellaneous Tools:

* [**Fronty**](https://fronty.com/)**:** Converts uploaded images or drawings into HTML and CSS code using AI. It?檚 a bit clunky, but a cool concept nonetheless.
* [**LetsEnhance**](https://letsenhance.io/)**:** Uses AI to enhance the resolution of images and photographs. Generally works pretty well from my experience, and gives you 10 free credits with signup. Unfortunately beyond that it is a paid product.
* [**Remove.bg**](http://remove.bg/)**:** Specializes in recognizing and removing image backgrounds effectively. Doesn?檛 promise much, but it does the job and doesn?檛 require you to sign up.

## TL;DR/Overall favorites:

These are the ones I've found the most use for in my day-to-day work.

* **Framer:** responsive website design with a full-featured editor to edit and publish your site all in one place. Free + paid plans.
* **Taskade:** visualize and automate your workflows, projects, mind maps, and more with AI powered templates. Free + paid plans.
* **Microsoft Designer:** generate social media and other marketing graphics with AI. Free to use.
* **Plus AI:** plugin for Google Slides to generate slide content, designs, and make tweaks with AI. Free + paid plans.
* **Pebblely:** professional-quality product photos in various settings and backgrounds, free to generate *up to 40 images* (through you can always sign up for another account??",458,64,1695663006,
Been Unemployed for 1 Year! ?槓,"It's official... I've been unemployed for 1 year.

I never thought it would be this long...

I've done everything.

Applied to specific jobs that fit my Marketing and Sales background.

Carpet bombed Indeed and LinkedIn with job automation tools and AI.

Had many recruiters and resume writers make suggestions to tweak my resume.

Used my network to ask for help. Agencies are cutting staff or marketing colleagues are also looking for work.

Applied to FedEx, rejected. Applied to Starbucks, didn't hear back. Applied to Post Office, silence. Applied to many other places. Countless rejections or ghosting.

I changed my resume to reflect customer service and restaurant experience back in the day. I guess it is too old.

Nada. The job market is insane.

I've done more than 8,000+ applications.

The interviews I have gotten the experience these companies are asking for is ridiculous.

I guess there are people with that experience that are willing to take low pay for sh\*t companies.

Companies just don't want to do any training. At all.

I blew threw a lot of money I saved for purchasing a house. Will take me years to build up that fund again.

It makes me crazy when politicians and the mainstream media is saying how great the economy is. This is a huge lie!

Vent... ?槓

UPDATE - With AI Tools you can do a lot of applications.

Initially I did a tailored job search and was using referrals. That wasn't working since we are in a sh\*t economy.

I will not respond to people that say this is too many applications.

UPDATE 2 - I was accepted into a Welding program. I might do that but the payscale for Welders isn't great.

I just passed the written & fitness test for the police, so I am applying there. Firefighting applications opened up here, just applied.

I have my own website projects. My professional marketing career is done.",125,94,1712728193,
